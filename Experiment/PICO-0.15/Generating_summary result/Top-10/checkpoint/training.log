INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : Iron supplementation improved motor and language development of preschool children in rural Africa . Mebendazole had a positive effect on motor development , but this was not statistically significant . Abstract Objective : To measure the effects of iron supplementation and anthelmintic treatment on motor and cognitive development in preschool children , it is important to determine whether iron supplementation is associated with improvements in these outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Iron supplementation improves mental development score modestly .
This effect is particularly apparent for intelligence tests above 7 years of age and in initially anaemic or iron-deficient anaemic subjects .
There is no convincing evidence that iron treatment has an effect on mental development in children below 27 months of age or on motor development
INFO:root:Generated summary: There were no significant differences in the 14- to 24-month growth rates among the r and omly assigned groups , in contrast to significant growth suppression in the Comb and MedMgt at the end of the treatment phase .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results suggest there is moderate-to-high-level evidence that combined pharmacological and behavioral interventions , and pharmacological interventions alone can be effective in managing the core ADHD symptoms and academic performance at 14 months .
However , the effect size may decrease beyond this period .
This review has highlighted the paucity and limitations of the evidence investigating the long-term outcomes of recommended interventions for managing ADHD symptoms .
There is little evidence to suggest that the effects observed over the relatively short term are maintained throughout longer periods of impairment .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is limited evidence to support the use of collagenase in the treatment of Dupuytren ’s disease .
In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to suggest that collagenase is more effective than placebo in the prevention and treatment of the disease than placebo .
However , the evidence is insufficient to support a change in clinical practice .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Outcomes , such as range of motion , recurrence , and clinical success , were frequently defined , however many different definitions were used .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that financial incentives may be effective in promoting weight loss and weight reduction in overweight and obese individuals .
However , it is unclear whether financial incentives are effective in reducing weight loss or weight gain in overweight or obese individuals , and whether they are effective for weight loss in obese individuals or not .
In conclusion , financial incentives appear to be effective at promoting weight reduction and weight loss , but they are not effective in weight loss
INFO:root:Reference summary: Our framework should help research ers and policy-makers identify the most effective incentive configurations for helping individuals adopt healthy behaviours
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of the present meta- analysis suggest that the use of coloured filters may be beneficial for children with PRVS .
However , there is insufficient evidence to suggest that coloured filters are effective in improving reading ability in children with the PRVS condition .
In conclusion , the results of this review suggest that there is limited evidence to support the benefits of using coloured filters in the treatment of PRVS in children
INFO:root:Reference summary: While many studies report improvements with coloured lenses , the effect size is generally small and /or similar to the improvement found with a placebo condition .
Consistent with previous review s and advice from several professional bodies , we conclude that the use of coloured lenses or overlays to ameliorate reading difficulties can not be endorsed and that any benefits reported by individuals in clinical setting s are likely to be the result of placebo , practice or Hawthorne effects
INFO:root:Generated summary: The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of a postoperative SSI . SSI has been associated with an increased risk of reoperation , prolonged hospitalization , readmission , and higher costs . Summary of Background Data : Although active warming during colorectal surgery reduces SSIs , there is limited evidence that perioperative normothermia is associated with lower rates of SSI
INFO:root:Reference summary: The results of this study suggest that preoperative warming can reduce rates of SSI after surgery .
INFO:root:Generated summary: However , no functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study has as yet investigated the effects of ATX on inhibitory or any other brain function in ADHD patients or compared its effects with those of MPX .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS The fMRI analysis showed that methylpheni date significantly enhanced activation in bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC)/insula during inhibition and time discrimination but had no effect on working memory networks .
The meta- analysis , including 14 fMRI data sets and 212 children with ADHD , showed that stimulants most consistently enhanced right IFC/insula activation , which also remained for a subgroup analysis of methylpheni date effects alone .
A more lenient threshold also revealed increased putamen activation .
CONCLUSIONS Psychostimulants most consistently increase right IFC/insula activation , which are key areas of cognitive control and also the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD .
These neurocognitive effects may underlie their positive clinical
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of the present meta- analysis suggest that PYC supplementation with the French maritime pine bark extract is associated with a significant increase in plasma polyphenol levels and an increase in the antioxidant capacity of plasma , as determined by ORAC , and a significant decrease in plasma lipid peroxides .
However , there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of PYC on the lipid profile in humans .
In conclusion , the present results suggest that the use of French maritime Pine Bark Extract ( PYC ) as a dietary supplement for the prevention of atherosclerosis in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CAD ) may have a beneficial effect on the plasma lipid profile
INFO:root:Reference summary: Present systematic review and meta- analysis suggested Pycnogenol consumption can decrease the level of CRP and have anti-inflammatory effect .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions /interpretationIn postmenopausal women , higher plasma levels of oestradiol and testosterone were strongly and prospect ively related to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Because of the heterogeneity and the limited number of studies , there is no sufficient evidence on the potential role of vasomotor symptoms in metabolic health .
However , both high- quality cohort studies , with large study population s and adjustment for multiple confounding variables showed positive associations between vasomotor symptoms and insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus .
These findings suggest that there is an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic health outcomes .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of imageless navigation in total hip arthroplasty .
However , it is possible that this technique may be effective in improving the accuracy of the reconstruction of leg length and global and femoral offset .
It is also possible that it may improve the quality of the postoperative reconstruction of the hip and the length of the femoral and acetabular joint .
There is no evidence to suggest that it is more effective than other surgical techniques in improving leg length .
In summary , the results of the current meta- analysis suggest that imaging is superior in terms of the accuracy and precision of the total hip reconstruction , but it is unclear whether it is superior to other
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results Significant differences were found in the femoral offset and overall complication rate between the conventional and navigation groups .
Additionally , the conventional group had significantly less anteversion than the navigation group .
However , the navigation group had significantly better inclination .
The operation time was significantly shorter in the conventional than navigation group .
Conclusion Both the OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional total hip arthroplasty result in significant improvements in patient function with similar overall complication rates and have their own advantages in achieving good cup position .
The conventional procedure has a shorter operation time than does use of a navigation system
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There was no significant difference in the effect of monetary incentives on the rate of positive tuberculin test reading .
In addition , no significant differences were observed between monetary incentives and non-monetary incentives in the rates of positive TB skin test reading , and no difference was observed between the two groups in terms of the number of positive test results .
However , there was no difference between the effects of monetary and nonmonetary incentive levels on the prevalence of positive tuberculosis skin test readings .
The results of the present meta- analysis suggest that monetary incentives may be effective in increasing the risk for positive TB test reading among drug users who are at high risk of TB infection .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours .
Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that probiotic supplementation with probiotics may have a beneficial effect on glycemic control and weight gain in women with GDM .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotic supplements in the prevention of GDM in pregnant women
INFO:root:Reference summary: Among secondary endpoints , a significant reduction of maternal insulin ( both in women with or without diabetes ) was observed in the probiotics group .
INTERPRETATION Probiotics during pregnancy do not reduce the incidence of GDM , with a very little ( statistically but not clinical ly significant ) reduction of fasting plasma glucose
INFO:root:Generated summary: CONCLUSIONS IGF-I could be implicated in the progression of premature CAD , and a reduction of serum IGFI concentration could account partly for the effect of bezafibrate on progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis .
In conclusion , the results of this meta- analysis suggest that fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids are associated with a significant reduction in serum IGF-1 and IGF-2 levels .
However , there is insufficient evidence to determine whether fibrate is associated with an effect on the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease .
The results of the meta-analyses suggest that the effects of fibracylation on serum IGF‐I and IGF‐2 are not associated with the development
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : This meta‐ analysis has shown that fibrate treatment  significantly decreases fasting plasma glucose , insulin levels , and HOMA‐IR indicating additional clinical therapeutic benefits .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that the ‘ food environment ’ and ‘ personal responsibility ’ attributions are associated with high levels of prejudice and blame , but not with low levels of self-efficacy .
In conclusion , there is no evidence that the ' food environment ' and ' personal responsibility ' attributions were associated with higher levels of weight-related prejudice or weight-stigmatising attitudes .
However , the ’ food environment’ is associated with lower levels of social stigma and greater self‐efficacy than ‘ health-related attitudes ’ .
Overall , the evidence suggests that ‘ foods ’ , ‘ people ’s ’ ’ attitudes and ’
INFO:root:Reference summary: Most question naires were brief , demonstrated adequate internal consistency , and tapped key cognitive and affective dimensions of weight bias such as stereotypes and blaming .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that nonoperative treatment of acute nonperforated appendicitis with antibiotics is the most effective and cost-effective treatment for patients with acute appendectomy .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of nonoperative antibiotic therapy for acute appendectomies in patients with appendectomy
INFO:root:Reference summary: With significantly higher efficacy and low complication rates , appendectomy remains the most effective treatment for patients with uncomplicated AA .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an extract of Serenoa repens in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms ( LUTS ) in patients with chronic benign prostate diseases with associated inflammation , also taking into consideration the influence of treatment on sexual function and , therefore , on patients ' quality of life .
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The question of whether iodine supplementation later in life can exert a favorable influence on the mental performance of iodine-deficient population s was addressed in various studies , but with contradictory results .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that NF may be effective in reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD but not in adults with ADHD .
However , it is unclear whether NF is effective in improving ADHD symptomatology in children with ADHD
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Olanzapine is superior to haloperidol and risperidone in the treatment of bipolar mania in patients with bipolar disorder .
However , the efficacy and safety profile of the drug was not significantly different between the two drugs .
The efficacy of the drugs was not different in terms of quality of life .
In terms of safety , the results were similar between the drugs .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for  acute mania .
From the limited data available , there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone .
Some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion LV systolic dysfunction by itself is not a predictor of outcome after AF ablation . Patients were matched by left atrial diameter ( LAD ) , the presence of arterial hypertension , and other variables that might influence the results ( age , gender and paroxysmal vs. persistent AF ) . After a mean follow-up of 16 ± 13 months , survival analysis for AF recurrences showed no differences between patients with depressed vs. normal LVEF ( 50.0 vs. 55.6 % , log rank = 0.855 ) . The presence of OSA should not lower the decision threshold to choose an ablative procedure .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Dilated LA significantly increases the risk of AF recurrence after  single CPVI .
This is especially applicable to the patients with long-term follow-up
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Cefazolin is effective in preventing surgical site infections in adults undergoing cardiac surgery .
However , it is not as effective as ticarcillin/clavulanate or vancomycin for the prevention of postoperative wound infections in patients undergoing cardiac procedures .
The results of this review suggest that the use of single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis in cardiac surgery is associated with a higher incidence of surgical site infection than ticarillin/Clavulin and vancomyxin , but not with a lower incidence of infection .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There were no statistically significant differences in mortality , infections overall and adverse events .
Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis of ≥24 hours may be more efficacious in preventing sternal SSIs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to shorter regimens .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Metformin is associated with an increase in serum homocysteine , folate and vitamin B12 concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes .
However , the effect of metformin on vitamin B-12 and folate concentrations was not significant .
The results of the meta- analysis suggest that the effects of the drug on homocystine are not significant and that it is not associated with a significant effect on folate or vitamin B 12 concentrations .
In conclusion , the results of this meta-analyses indicate that the drug does not appear to have an effect on the levels of folate , vitamin B6 , B12 or vitamin C .
It is not clear whether the drug is associated
INFO:root:Reference summary: Therefore , although the overall effect of metformin on the concentration of serum Hcy was neutral , our results suggested that metformin could increase the concentration of Hcy when exogenous B-group vitamins or folic acid supplementation was not given
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that MUFA-based diets may be effective in improving glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity in subjects with high fasting triglyceride concentrations .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of MUFAs as a dietary intervention to improve insulin sensitivity and β cell function .
The results of this meta-analyses suggest that MUFA-based dietary interventions may be beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity , but that the effects of MUFA supplementation on insulin sensitivity are unclear .
In conclusion , the evidence from this meta‐analyses suggests that dietary interventions that increase MUFA intake may be associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity .
MUFAs may be an effective dietary intervention for improving insulin
INFO:root:Reference summary: In contrast , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not affected by the amounts of MUFA in the dietary protocol s. Conclusions : In summary , this systematic review found that high MUFA diets appear to be effective in reducing HbA1c , and therefore , should be recommended in the dietary regimes of T2D
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Preoperative IMT is effective in reducing the incidence of PPCs in patients undergoing CABG surgery .
However , it does not appear to be associated with a significant reduction in postoperative pulmonary complications .
It is unclear whether it is associated with an improvement in pulmonary function , but it is possible that it may have a beneficial effect on pulmonary function .
In conclusion , the evidence suggests that preoperative physical therapy may be effective in improving pulmonary function and reducing the risk of postoperative PPC in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
The evidence is inconclusive on the effect of preoperative PT on the incidence and duration of pulmonary complications , but there is evidence to suggest that it has an effect on
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: There appeared to be a threshold for milk , with 40 % lower risk of hip fracture among those with medium/high milk intake compared with those with low intake ( p = 0.061 ) . These results suggest that greater intakes of milk and milk + yogurt may lower risk for hip fracture in older adults through mechanisms that are partially , but not entirely , attributable to effects of milk .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions The use of hydrolyzed protein formula in preterm infants is associated with a significant improvement in gastrointestinal motility .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of a hydrolysate formula in the treatment of preterm infant gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GER ) .
The use of an eHPF in the management of GER is not associated with an improvement in gastric motility or in the prevention of GER .
There is limited evidence to suggest that hydrolyzing protein formula is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of GER
INFO:root:Reference summary: The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding preterm infants  with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .
The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with protein hydrolysate affects the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that home health education is effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in children and young adults in a low-re source setting s .
However , it is unclear whether it is more effective in preventing cardiovascular disease than other interventions .
The results of this meta-analyses suggest that home-based education may be more effective than other home health interventions in reducing cardiovascular disease risk in children , young adults , and older adults .
Conclusion Home-based home based education is an effective home health intervention in preventing and treating cardiovascular disease , but it may not be effective in managing cardiovascular disease
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions There is a dearth of evidence on the implementation of task-shifting strategies to reduce the burden of CVD in LMICs .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion A nurse-led systematic telephone follow-up intervention significantly improved the physical dimension of health-related quality of life in patients in the intervention group compared with usual care patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was evidence to suggest that education can improve HRQoL and decrease healthcare costs by reductions in downstream healthcare utilization .
Conclusions : Our review had insufficient power to exclude clinical ly important effects of education on mortality and morbidity .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of the current meta- analysis suggest that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of pedometer-based physical activity interventions to increase walking cadence in adults .
However , there is evidence to suggest that pedometers may be effective in increasing the number of minutes of moderate-to-high-intensity walking in adults and that they may be beneficial in increasing walking cadences .
The current evidence is insufficient to support a recommendation to use pedometers to increase the amount of time spent walking in moderate- to high-intensity physical activity .
There is limited evidence that pedometer -based interventions are effective in improving walking activity in adults , but the evidence is not sufficient to support their use in children or adolescents
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , adiponectin was associated with an increased risk of developing high-grade prostate cancer and a lower risk of dying from the cancer by 2007 compared with controls .
However , the association was not statistically significant for other risk factors .
In the meta- analysis , the relationship was not significant .
Overall , the results suggest that the association between the two risk factors for high- grade prostate cancer was not significantly associated with the risk of death from the disease by 2007 .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The current evidence does not suggest an association between leptin and PCa outcome .
However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Vitamin C is safe and effective in the prevention and treatment of the common cold , but it is not effective for the treatment of other common colds .
In conclusion , vitamin C is effective in preventing and treating colds but not for other colds
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The RMQ has been shown to be a useful measure of the quality of life of patients with low back pain , but its use in clinical trials is limited .
It is unclear whether the RMQ can be used as a measure of quality-of-life for patients with lower back pain .
In conclusion , RMQs are a useful tool for assessing the quality- of-life of patients and their caregivers , but their use is limited in clinical practice .
The use of RMQ as a quality -of -life measure is limited for the evaluation of quality of health-related quality of care and is not suitable for the use of clinical trials .
However , it is possible to use RMQ s as a
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options .
Negative changes were not associated with larger ESs .
Population -based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with smaller ESs , and acute conditions with larger ESs .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is limited evidence that cannabis use is associated with an increase in psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia .
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cannabis as a predictor of psychotic symptoms , but there is some evidence that it may be associated with a decrease in psychotic symptom severity .
However , there is no evidence for an association between cannabis use and psychotic symptoms .
In conclusion , cannabis use was not associated with any significant effect on psychotic symptoms or symptoms of psychosis and depression .
We found no evidence of a significant effect of cannabis use on psychosis and symptoms of depression and anxiety .
Conclusions Cannabis use was associated with psychotic symptoms and depression , but not with psychosis .
The results of the meta- analysis
INFO:root:Reference summary: INTERPRETATION Continued cannabis use after onset of psychosis predicts adverse outcome , including higher relapse rates , longer hospital admissions , and more severe positive symptoms than for individuals who discontinue cannabis use and those who are non-users .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that the use of intravenous iron as an adjunct to ESA therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease is safe and effective in reducing the risk of bacteremia .
However , there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the administration of iron is associated with a significant reduction in the risk for bacteemia in patients undergoing ESA therapy .
INFO:root:Reference summary: High-dose parenteral iron does not seem to be associated with higher risk of infection , all-cause mortality , increased hospitalization or increased cardiovascular events on analysis of RCTs .
Observational studies show increased risk for all-cause mortality , infections and hospitalizations that were not statistically significant and were associated with significant heterogeneity
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that weight loss is associated with a significant reduction in plasma CRP levels in obese postmenopausal women .
However , the effect of weight loss on CRP was not statistically significant in the HF-HP group .
The HF-SP group showed no significant effect on plasma glucose and insulin levels .
In conclusion , weight loss was not associated with significant changes in CRP or insulin levels , but it was associated with an increase in plasma glucose levels and a decrease in plasma insulin concentrations .
Furthermore , there was no significant difference in the effects of the LF-HP diet on plasma insulin and plasma glucose .
There were no significant differences between the two diets in terms of the effect on
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS Weight loss was associated with a decline in CRP level .
Our results suggest that weight loss may be an effective nonpharmacologic strategy for lowering CRP level
INFO:root:Generated summary: The six studies reported in the current study show the durability of the long-term results of cemented total hip arthroplasty , the improvement in radiographic reproducibility obtained on the femoral side of the construct with improved cementing techniques , the deleterious effects of using cable to reattach the greater trochanter , the adverse effects of changing femoral component design that included a change in surface finish , and the improvement of acetabular fixation using cementless fixation
INFO:root:Reference summary: INTERPRETATION There was a clinical ly relevant association between early migration of acetabular cups  and late revision due to loosening .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : Preterm infants and children with preterm prematurity are more likely to be diagnosed with language delays than non-preterm infants .
However , there is insufficient evidence to suggest that preterm infants or children with VPT are at greater risk of developing language delays .
There is limited evidence to support the use of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised at 3–4 years of age to assess language development in preterm children .
In conclusion , the results of this review suggest that there is no evidence that the prevalence of language delays in children born preterm is greater than that of children born full term .
The results of the review show that the use and quality of language development
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS : Preterm-born children scored significantly lower compared with term-born children on simple ( d = –0.45 [ 95 % CI : –0.59 to –0.30 ] ; P < .001 ) and on complex ( d = –0.62 [ 95 % CI : –0.82 to –0.43 ] ; P < .001 ) language function tests , even in the absence of major disabilities and independent of social economic status .
: While growing up , preterm-born children have increasing difficulties with complex language function

INFO:root:Generated summary: The DASH diet was associated with a significant reduction in C-reactive protein ( CRP ) levels , fasting blood glucose , and A1C .
However , it was not associated with an increase in plasma fibrinogen levels .
The effect of the DASH eating pattern on CRP levels was not significant .
In conclusion , the diet had no significant effect on the CRP , fasting glucose , or A1c .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The DASH dietary pattern may lead to an improvement in insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss .
The DASH diet may play an important role in glycemic control in long- term interventions .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : Vildagliptin significantly reduced glycemic variability in patients with T2DM , but not pioglitazone , and did not significantly improve glycemic control .
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , the effect of the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor on glucose variability was not significantly different from that of the placebo group .
However , the effects of the other two drugs were not different .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Initial combination therapy with DPP-IV inhibitors more effectively reduced MAGE than stepwise add-on therapies ( p = 0.006 ) , although no differences in MAGE were found based on HbA1c values .
These findings indicate that DPP-IV inhibitors are promising alternatives for reducing GV in type 2 diabetes patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions The results of this meta- analysis suggest that a 7-wk low-intensity wheelchair training program may be more effective than a 5-wk high-intensity training program in improving physical work capacity in able-bodied individuals with spinal cord injury ( SCI ) during rehabilitation .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : Exercise training programs seem to be effective in improving wheelchair propulsion capacity .
However , there is remarkably little research , particularly for individuals who do not have spinal-cord injury

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that social adversities are associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes in adulthood .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the existence of a causal relationship between social adversity and adverse physical outcomes .
In conclusion , social adversity is associated with a greater risk of a range of adverse physical health outcomes , including cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and obesity .
Conclusions Social adversities may have a significant effect on physical health in adulthood , but the evidence is insufficient to support a causal link between social factors and these outcomes
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention

However , there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the effects of surgery on the pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics are similar to those of conventional therapy .
The results of this meta-analyses suggest that the effect of surgery is similar to that of conventional surgery in terms of pharmacokinetic effects on oral antibiotics , but that the effects on the bioavailability of oral drugs are not comparable to those observed in the control group
INFO:root:Reference summary: Patients given oral beta-lactams and macrolides warrant close monitoring due to unpredictable absorption post-bariatric surgery , whereas oral fluoroquinolones and linezolid may not be affected .
Several studies also showed decreased absorption following RYGB , as well as lower serum exposure in patients with obesity compared to non-obese controls .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions The results of this meta- analysis suggest that the use of progestin alone is associated with a significant increase in negative mood and physical symptoms in postmenopausal women with mild to moderate depression .
However , the effect of the addition of progesterone alone was not significant .
The results of the meta-analyses showed that the effects of estrogen alone on negative mood were not significantly different from those of the combination of estrogen and progestins .
In conclusion , the results suggest that estrogen alone is not associated with an increase in depressive symptoms in women with moderate to severe depression
INFO:root:Reference summary: This moderate to large effect size , showing lower ratings of depressed mood in treated patients compared with controls , implicated HRT as a potential treatment of or prophylactic for depression in menopausal women .
One can generalize from the studies review ed here only with great caution , but there is little evidence to support the use of estradiol to improve mood in nondepressed patients ( not surprisingly ) and some evidence to support the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal women

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There was no significant difference in the risk of death between the two groups .
In the absence of evidence of a difference in PSA levels between the groups , there is insufficient evidence to recommend immediate ADT in patients with PCa .
However , there was no evidence for a significant difference between ADT and no ADT
INFO:root:Reference summary: Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy .
PSA doubling time in < 3 yr or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention .
In men with locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not m and atory , watchful waiting ( WW ) is a treatment alternative to and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) with equivalent oncologic efficacy .
Active treatment is mostly recommended for patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy  with  radical prostatectomy ( RP ) shown to be superior to WW in a prospect i ve r and omised trial .

SSSDs did not result in a significant decrease in body mass or body weight .
However , they did result in significant reductions in body weight and BMI .
In addition , SSSD consumption was associated with an increase in total cholesterol and triglycerides and a decrease in total lipids .
Overall , the results of the meta- analysis suggest that the consumption of sucrose-sweetened soft drinks and HFCS is associated with significant weight and body mass reductions , but no significant changes in BMI or body mass and body weight

INFO:root:Reference summary: There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours .
Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that probiotics may be effective in reducing the risk of developing GDM in women with GDM , but not in preventing GDM .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics in GDM patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Among secondary endpoints , a significant reduction of maternal insulin ( both in women with or without diabetes ) was observed in the probiotics group .
INTERPRETATION Probiotics during pregnancy do not reduce the incidence of GDM , with a very little ( statistically but not clinical ly significant ) reduction of fasting plasma glucose
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions The results of this meta- analysis suggest that fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids are associated with a reduction in serum IGF-I levels , but not with a significant reduction in plasma insulin levels .
Conclusions Fibrates may be effective in reducing plasma insulin concentrations in patients with hypertriglyceridemia .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of fibrate on plasma insulin concentration .
There is no evidence to support the use of bezafibrate as an anti-inflammatory agent in the prevention of cardiovascular disease .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : This meta‐ analysis has shown that fibrate treatment  significantly decreases fasting plasma glucose , insulin levels , and HOMA‐IR indicating additional clinical therapeutic benefits .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Results : In Study 1 , biological attributions were associated with low weight-malleability beliefs and blame , high weight-stigmatising attitudes , and low self-efficacy .
In Study 2 , there was no significant association between biological and psychological attributions .
Conclusions This review suggests that there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of biological and psychosocial attributions on weight-related beliefs and behaviour .
However , the findings suggest that biological attributIONS may be associated with lower weight-morbidity beliefs and lower selfefficacy , but not with lower body weight .
There is no evidence to support a causal relationship between biological or psychosociological attributions and obesity .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Serenoa repens on urinary symptoms in patients with chronic benign prostate diseases .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that the use of this extract is associated with an improvement in urinary symptoms , but not with erectile function .
It is not clear whether this effect is due to an effect of the extract alone or in combination with other drugs .
However , the results suggest that this extract may be associated with a significant improvement in bladder voiding and lower urinary tract symptoms in men with chronic BPH
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that iodine supplementation is associated with an improvement in cognitive performance .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of iodine supplementation on cognitive performance in children with iodine deficiency .
There is limited evidence to support iodine supplementation in children who are moderately to severely iodine deficient .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that NF may be an effective treatment for ADHD .
However , it is not clear whether NF is superior to other treatments for ADHD or not .
Conclusions The meta-analyses suggest that NF is not superior to any other treatment .
There is insufficient evidence to support NF as an effective ADHD treatment .
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Olanzapine appears to be superior to haloperidol in the treatment of bipolar mania .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support its use in the management of Bipolar mania in patients with dementia
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for  acute mania .
From the limited data available , there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone .
Some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion LV systolic dysfunction by itself is not a significant predictor of AF recurrence .
However , it may be an important predictor of the recurrence rate after AF ablation .
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of LV diastolic dysfunction as a predictor of recurrence after AF .
This review does not address the effect of AF diostolic dysfunction on AF recurrences .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Metformin is associated with a significant reduction in serum homocysteine concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes .
It is also associated with an increase in serum folate concentrations .
However , there is no evidence that metformin has a significant effect on serum vitamin B12 levels .
Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of metformins for the prevention of vitamin B-12 deficiency in type 2 diabetics .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Therefore , although the overall effect of metformin on the concentration of serum Hcy was neutral , our results suggested that metformin could increase the concentration of Hcy when exogenous B-group vitamins or folic acid supplementation was not given
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that MUFA-based diets may be effective in improving glycaemic control , insulin sensitivity , and β cell function .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of MUFAs to improve insulin sensitivity .
Conclusions MUFA supplementation may be beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in subjects with high fasting triglyceride concentrations .
There is limited evidence to suggest that supplementation with MUFA may improve glucose and insulin sensitivity in subjects at high risk of developing diabetes .
MUFAs may also improve HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterolemia , but not insulin sensitivity or β-corticotropin .
CONCLUSIONS MUFA supplements may be
INFO:root:Reference summary: In contrast , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not affected by the amounts of MUFA in the dietary protocol s. Conclusions : In summary , this systematic review found that high MUFA diets appear to be effective in reducing HbA1c , and therefore , should be recommended in the dietary regimes of T2D
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Preoperative IMT is effective in reducing the incidence of PPCs in patients undergoing CABG surgery .
However , it does not reduce the incidence or duration of postoperative hospitalization .
It does not improve the quality of life of the patients who receive IMT .
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of IMT in the management of CABGs .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: There appeared to be no significant association between total protein intake and the risk of hip fracture in older adults .
However , there was some evidence that high-protein diets were associated with a lower risk of fracture .
There was no evidence that higher protein intake was associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis .
Conclusions This systematic review suggests that high protein intake may be associated with lower risk for hip fracture .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume

However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of hydrolysate protein formula in reducing GER .
There is insufficient data to support its use in reducing symptoms of GER , but there is some evidence that hydrolyzed proteins may improve motility .
Conclusions There is limited evidence to suggest that hydrolysated protein formula is effective in improving motility , but it is unclear whether it is superior to other formulas for reducing GER symptoms .
It is not clear whether hydrolysates are superior to st and ard formulas for improving gastric emptying .
Conclusion Hydrolysate proteins may be an effective option for reducing
INFO:root:Reference summary: The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding preterm infants  with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .
The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with protein hydrolysate affects the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .

INFO:root:Generated summary: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pedometers for increasing walking cadence in adults .
However , there is some evidence that pedometers may be effective in increasing walking intensity .
There is limited evidence to suggest that pedometer-based physical activity interventions may improve blood pressure in adults , but the evidence is insufficient to support their use in adults
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant association between adiponectin levels and the risk of developing prostate cancer .
However , there was an association between leptin levels and a lower risk of prostate cancer in men who had undergone RP .
There was not a significant relationship between leptin concentrations and a higher risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer , but there was a significant association with a lower likelihood of developing the disease .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The current evidence does not suggest an association between leptin and PCa outcome .
However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that vitamin C is safe and effective in preventing and treating the common cold .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin C for the prevention and treatment of other common colds .
Conclusions The current evidence does not support vitamin C as a first-line treatment for common cold prevention or treatment .
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .

There is limited evidence to suggest that the use of cannabis may be associated with an increase in psychotic symptoms , but not with a decrease in psychotic symptom severity .
Conclusions Cannabis use is not associated with any negative effects on clinical outcome .
It is not clear whether cannabis use has a positive effect on psychotic symptoms or symptoms of depression or anxiety .
INFO:root:Reference summary: INTERPRETATION Continued cannabis use after onset of psychosis predicts adverse outcome , including higher relapse rates , longer hospital admissions , and more severe positive symptoms than for individuals who discontinue cannabis use and those who are non-users .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that iron supplementation is safe and effective in reducing the risk of bacteremia in patients with chronic kidney disease .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of iron supplementation as an adjuvant to erythropoietin or erythrocyte-stimulating agents ( ESA ) in PD patients
INFO:root:Reference summary: High-dose parenteral iron does not seem to be associated with higher risk of infection , all-cause mortality , increased hospitalization or increased cardiovascular events on analysis of RCTs .
Observational studies show increased risk for all-cause mortality , infections and hospitalizations that were not statistically significant and were associated with significant heterogeneity
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference between the two diets .
There were no significant differences between the diets , but the LF-HP diet was associated with a significant reduction in plasma CRP levels .
The HF-HP group had a significantly greater reduction in CRP concentrations than the HF-SP group .
However , the difference was not statistically significant .
In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of LFHP diets on CRP .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that there is a strong association between social factors and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later life .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of social factors on cardiovascular disease .
There is limited evidence that social factors are associated with cardiovascular disease risk in early adulthood .
Conclusions The meta-analyses suggest that there are strong associations between sociodemographic factors and cardiovascular risk in young adults .
The meta-Analyses also suggest that social relations may be an important factor in the development of cardiovascular risk .
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention

However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of progestins for the treatment of depressive disorders in older women .
INFO:root:Reference summary: This moderate to large effect size , showing lower ratings of depressed mood in treated patients compared with controls , implicated HRT as a potential treatment of or prophylactic for depression in menopausal women .
One can generalize from the studies review ed here only with great caution , but there is little evidence to support the use of estradiol to improve mood in nondepressed patients ( not surprisingly ) and some evidence to support the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal women

INFO:root:Reference summary: Results The results of the meta- analysis show an effect toward the experimental group .
Notably , prevention studies with individual psychoeducational programmes that include diet and /or physical activity seem to have the highest impact .
Conclusions When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and individual lifestyle interventions that include diet and physical activity generally prove to be effective in reducing weight .
This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of the present systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that the use of coloured filters may have a beneficial effect on the behaviour of children with visual stress .
Conclusion : The use of colored filters may be effective in improving the behavior of children and adolescents with visual impairment .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of coloured filter systems on the behavior and behaviour of adults with visual impairments .
The current systematic review is the first systematic review to provide evidence that coloured filters have a positive effect on behaviour and behaviour in children with reading impairment .
INFO:root:Reference summary: While many studies report improvements with coloured lenses , the effect size is generally small and /or similar to the improvement found with a placebo condition .
Consistent with previous review s and advice from several professional bodies , we conclude that the use of coloured lenses or overlays to ameliorate reading difficulties can not be endorsed and that any benefits reported by individuals in clinical setting s are likely to be the result of placebo , practice or Hawthorne effects

INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , methylpheni date hydrochloride and ATX have similar effects on brain activity in ADHD patients .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of either of these drugs for the treatment of ADHD .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS The fMRI analysis showed that methylpheni date significantly enhanced activation in bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC)/insula during inhibition and time discrimination but had no effect on working memory networks .
The meta- analysis , including 14 fMRI data sets and 212 children with ADHD , showed that stimulants most consistently enhanced right IFC/insula activation , which also remained for a subgroup analysis of methylpheni date effects alone .
A more lenient threshold also revealed increased putamen activation .
CONCLUSIONS Psychostimulants most consistently increase right IFC/insula activation , which are key areas of cognitive control and also the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD .
These neurocognitive effects may underlie their positive clinical

However , both high- quality cohort studies , with large study population s and adjustment for multiple confounding variables showed positive associations between vasomotor symptoms and insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus .
These findings suggest that there is an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic health outcomes .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of imageless navigation in total hip arthroplasty .
However , it is not clear whether this technique is superior to fluoroscopy for the reconstruction of leg length and global and femoral offset in THA .
There is limited evidence to suggest that it is superior in terms of accuracy and precision .
In addition , the available evidence does not support its use in the management of postoperative pain .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results Significant differences were found in the femoral offset and overall complication rate between the conventional and navigation groups .
Additionally , the conventional group had significantly less anteversion than the navigation group .
However , the navigation group had significantly better inclination .
The operation time was significantly shorter in the conventional than navigation group .
Conclusion Both the OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional total hip arthroplasty result in significant improvements in patient function with similar overall complication rates and have their own advantages in achieving good cup position .
The conventional procedure has a shorter operation time than does use of a navigation system

The results also suggest that treatment with the extract of Serene repens may be associated with an improvement in other urinary symptoms .
In conclusion , the results of the present systematic review and meta-analyses indicate that the treatment with Serene Repens may have a significant effect on urinary symptoms in patients with chronic benign prostate diseases .
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that long-term iodized salt supplementation is associated with an improvement in cognitive performance in children with iodine deficiency .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of iodine supplementation on cognitive performance .
The results suggest that iodine supplementation may not be associated with a significant effect on the cognitive performance of children .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis suggests that NF may be an effective treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents .
However , it is not clear whether NF is effective in reducing ADHD symptoms .
Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of NF in ADHD treatment .
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .

However , there is some evidence to suggest that IMT is effective in reducing the incidence of PPCs .
There is limited evidence that preoperative physical therapy is associated with a significant reduction in postoperative pulmonary complications .
CONCLUSIONS Preoperative physical training may be effective in preventing pulmonary complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant association between total protein intake and the risk of hip fracture .
Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis suggests that high-protein diets may be associated with a lower risk for hip fracture in older adults .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of high protein intake on hip fracture risk .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence to support the use of pedometer-based physical activity interventions to increase walking cadence in adults .
Pedometers may be effective in increasing walking intensity .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use in the management of physical activity
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant association between adiponectin and the risk of developing prostate cancer .
There was also no association between leptin and risk of prostate cancer , but there was a significant association with risk of death .
CONCLUSIONS The current meta- analysis suggests that leptin is associated with an increased risk of early prostate cancer and a higher risk of dying from prostate cancer
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The current evidence does not suggest an association between leptin and PCa outcome .
However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions The available evidence suggests that oral vitamin C is safe and effective in the prevention of colds , but that it is not effective for the treatment of other common colds .
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin C as a prophylactic treatment for other colds
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that social factors are associated with an increased risk of developing chronic diseases in later life .
Conclusions The systematic review and meta- analysis of the literature supports the existence of associations between social factors and a range of chronic diseases , including cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , and hypertension .
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention

There were no significant differences in the rate of death .
Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of immediate ADT for the detection of PCa
INFO:root:Reference summary: Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy .
PSA doubling time in < 3 yr or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention .
In men with locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not m and atory , watchful waiting ( WW ) is a treatment alternative to and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) with equivalent oncologic efficacy .
Active treatment is mostly recommended for patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy  with  radical prostatectomy ( RP ) shown to be superior to WW in a prospect i ve r and omised trial .

INFO:root:Reference summary: Results The results of the meta- analysis show an effect toward the experimental group .
Notably , prevention studies with individual psychoeducational programmes that include diet and /or physical activity seem to have the highest impact .
Conclusions When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and individual lifestyle interventions that include diet and physical activity generally prove to be effective in reducing weight .
This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone .

Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this review suggest that probiotic supplementation may be effective in reducing the risk of developing gestational diabetes in women with GDM .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics for the prevention of GDM in pregnant women
INFO:root:Reference summary: Among secondary endpoints , a significant reduction of maternal insulin ( both in women with or without diabetes ) was observed in the probiotics group .
INTERPRETATION Probiotics during pregnancy do not reduce the incidence of GDM , with a very little ( statistically but not clinical ly significant ) reduction of fasting plasma glucose
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , bezafibrate is effective in reducing serum IGF-I levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about its effect on the effect of fibrates on glycaemic control .
In addition , the effect is not clear for the effect on serum insulin levels .
There is insufficient data to draw a firm conclusion about the effects of bezfibrate on glucose homeostasis parameters .
CONCLUSIONS Bezfibers are effective in lowering serum levels of insulin , but their effects are not clear .
It is unclear whether they are superior to other anti-inflammatory drugs for the prevention of atherosclerosis .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : This meta‐ analysis has shown that fibrate treatment  significantly decreases fasting plasma glucose , insulin levels , and HOMA‐IR indicating additional clinical therapeutic benefits .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence for the reliability and validity of the Cronbach Scale and its validity as a psychometric instrument .
The Cronbach scale is a well-validated instrument that can be used as a tool for measuring the prevalence of mental illness and its association with weight-related attitudes and behaviours .
It is a useful tool for assessing the prevalence and quality of mental health problems , as well as for the identification of individuals with mental illness .
However , it is not clear whether it is a reliable tool to measure the prevalence or quality of psychological disorders .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the reliability of this instrument .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Most question naires were brief , demonstrated adequate internal consistency , and tapped key cognitive and affective dimensions of weight bias such as stereotypes and blaming .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , the current evidence suggests that nonoperative treatment of acute appendicitis with antibiotics is safe and effective .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of antibiotics as a first-line treatment in the management of acute nonperforated appendicitus in children .
INFO:root:Reference summary: With significantly higher efficacy and low complication rates , appendectomy remains the most effective treatment for patients with uncomplicated AA .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that the use of Serenoa repens for the treatment of LUTS is associated with a significant improvement in the Qmax , Qmed , and Qmed scores , as well as with a reduction in the PVR .
In conclusion , the evidence for the efficacy of this therapy is inconclusive .
The evidence for its efficacy in the management of other urinary symptoms is insufficient to support its use as a first-line treatment for LUTs in patients with BPH
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this review suggest that long-term iodine prophylaxis is effective in reducing the risk of MTF in children and adolescents who are moderately to severely iodine-deficient .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of iodine supplementation on cognitive development in children .
The results suggest that iodine supplementation may not be effective in improving cognitive performance in children who are mildly to moderately iodine deficient .
There is limited evidence to support the use of long-acting iodine prophylline as a first-line treatment for MTF
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this review suggest that NF may be an effective treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents who have been diagnosed with the disorder .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of NF as an adjunctive treatment for the treatment of ADHD .
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The efficacy and safety of olanzapine and risperidone is comparable to that of haloperidol in the treatment of bipolar disorder .
The efficacy of risperidine is comparable with that of other antipsychotics .
Risperidine has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in patients with bipolar disorder , but its efficacy is not comparable with those of other drugs .
In patients with schizophrenia , the efficacy is similar with respect to other drugs , but the safety is not .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of either of these drugs in the management of schizophrenia
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for  acute mania .
From the limited data available , there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone .
Some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there was no significant difference in the rate of recurrence of AF recurrence after catheter ablation .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of AF ablation on the recurrence rate of AF .
However , there is some evidence to support the use of catheters for the treatment of AF in patients with obstructive sleep apnea .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Dilated LA significantly increases the risk of AF recurrence after  single CPVI .
This is especially applicable to the patients with long-term follow-up
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of single-dose cefazolin for the prevention of postoperative wound infections after cardiac surgery .
However , it is possible that single-doses may be effective in reducing the incidence of surgical site infections .
There is insufficient data to support a recommendation for the routine use of multiple-dose Cefazolins for the treatment of surgical wound infections .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There were no statistically significant differences in mortality , infections overall and adverse events .
Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis of ≥24 hours may be more efficacious in preventing sternal SSIs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to shorter regimens .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Metformin is effective in reducing serum homocysteine levels in patients with type 2 diabetes .
Metformin has been shown to reduce the levels of homocystine , folate , and vitamin B12 in patients who have been treated with insulin .
However , the effects of metformin on homocystenine and folate levels are not clear .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of the use of the drug on the effects on vitamin B-12 levels in people with diabetes
INFO:root:Reference summary: Therefore , although the overall effect of metformin on the concentration of serum Hcy was neutral , our results suggested that metformin could increase the concentration of Hcy when exogenous B-group vitamins or folic acid supplementation was not given
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this review suggest that MUFA-based diets may be effective in improving glycaemic control in people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of MUFA supplementation on insulin sensitivity .
There is limited evidence to support the use of MUFAs as an adjunct to other dietary interventions to improve insulin sensitivity in people with diabetes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In contrast , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not affected by the amounts of MUFA in the dietary protocol s. Conclusions : In summary , this systematic review found that high MUFA diets appear to be effective in reducing HbA1c , and therefore , should be recommended in the dietary regimes of T2D
INFO:root:Generated summary: Preoperative physical training is effective in reducing the incidence of PPCs in patients undergoing CABG surgery .
Preoperative training may also reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients at high risk of developing a PPC .
The effectiveness of preoperative physical therapy in reducing postoperative complications is not yet clear .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant association between total protein intake and the risk of hip fracture in the Framingham Original Cohort .
However , there was a positive association between high-protein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol intake .
There was a negative association between low-protein intake and a lower risk of fracture .
In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the role of dairy products in the prevention of hip fractures in older adults
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Hydrolyzed protein formula ( HPF ) is effective in reducing the incidence of GER in preterm infants .
It is safe to assume that hydrolysate protein formula is safe and effective in preventing and treating GER .
However , it is unclear whether it is safe or effective in improving gastrointestinal motility .
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of HPF for the prevention of GER .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding preterm infants  with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .
The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with protein hydrolysate affects the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion This systematic review provides evidence that home-based home health education is effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in children and young adults in low-re source setting s .
Home-based education is an effective and cost-effective way to reduce the risk factors for cardiovascular disease and improve the quality of life of children and adolescents .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions There is a dearth of evidence on the implementation of task-shifting strategies to reduce the burden of CVD in LMICs .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there was no significant difference between the two groups in QoL .
There was no evidence that the PBL intervention was associated with a significant reduction in the use of hospital-based health care services .
The PBL interventions were associated with an increase in physical activity and a decrease in hospital-associated health care costs .
However , there were no significant differences in the number of patients who participated in the intervention .
Conclusion There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of PBL on health-related quality of life .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was evidence to suggest that education can improve HRQoL and decrease healthcare costs by reductions in downstream healthcare utilization .
Conclusions : Our review had insufficient power to exclude clinical ly important effects of education on mortality and morbidity .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the role of height and stride length in the development of walking cadence in adults .
However , it is possible that both of these factors may play a role in the design and implementation of pedometer-based physical activity interventions .
Pedometers may be a useful tool for measuring walking cadences in adults
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , adiponectin is associated with an increased risk of developing high-grade prostate cancer , but not with a lower risk of dying from the disease .
There is insufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between adiponsectin and the risk of prostate cancer .
However , there is some evidence to suggest that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels may be associated with a higher risk of early-onset prostate cancer in men .
In addition , there was evidence that low HDL-cholesterol levels are associated with increased prostate cancer risk in men who are overweight or obese
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The current evidence does not suggest an association between leptin and PCa outcome .
However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of large doses of vitamin C for the prevention and treatment of colds .
There is no convincing evidence that vitamin C is safe or effective in the prevention or treatment of the common cold .
Conclusions The current evidence does not support the routine use of high-dose vitamin C as a prophylactic treatment for colds , nor does it support its use in the treatment of other colds
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , the RMQ is the most commonly used measure of quality of life in clinical trials .
The RMQ has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure of health-related quality-of-life change in patients with low back pain .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support its use as a measure of clinical ly relevant change .
There is insufficient data to support the use of RMQ as an independent measure of patient-reported change in quality- of-life changes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options .
Negative changes were not associated with larger ESs .
Population -based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with smaller ESs , and acute conditions with larger ESs .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the association between cannabis use and clinical outcomes in people with schizophrenia .
Cannabis use is associated with a significant increase in psychotic symptoms , but not with clinical outcomes .
There is limited evidence that cannabis use has a negative effect on psychosocial functioning , but no clear evidence that it has a positive effect on clinical outcome .
In addition , there is insufficient data to support a positive association between the effects of cannabis use on clinical outcomes , such as depression , anxiety , and psychosis .
INFO:root:Reference summary: INTERPRETATION Continued cannabis use after onset of psychosis predicts adverse outcome , including higher relapse rates , longer hospital admissions , and more severe positive symptoms than for individuals who discontinue cannabis use and those who are non-users .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In patients with chronic kidney disease , the risk of bacteremia was not significantly associated with the frequency of iron administration .
There was no significant association between iron administration frequency and the incidence of BAC .
In patients who had anemia , there was no association between frequency of intravenous iron administration and BAC , but there was a significant association with the rate of baculocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating hormone ( C-reactive protein ( CRP ) deficiency .
Conclusions : The current evidence suggests that iron administration is safe and effective as an adjuvant to erythropoietin and erythrocyte retinol therapy in patients with anemia .
The
INFO:root:Reference summary: High-dose parenteral iron does not seem to be associated with higher risk of infection , all-cause mortality , increased hospitalization or increased cardiovascular events on analysis of RCTs .
Observational studies show increased risk for all-cause mortality , infections and hospitalizations that were not statistically significant and were associated with significant heterogeneity
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that weight loss is associated with a reduction in CRP levels .
However , it is possible that the effects of weight loss on CRP may be mediated by a combination of changes in adiposity , adiponectin , insulin resistance , and glucose homeostasis .
There is insufficient data to support a relationship between weight loss and CRP , but there is some evidence to suggest that a reduction of adiposity may be associated with an improvement in insulin resistance .
Conclusions Weight loss may be an effective strategy to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in obese individuals
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS Weight loss was associated with a decline in CRP level .
Our results suggest that weight loss may be an effective nonpharmacologic strategy for lowering CRP level

INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of asthma in children and adolescents .
Vitamin D supplementation does not appear to be associated with an increase in the risk of developing asthma .
However , it is possible that vitamin D may have a beneficial effect on the prevention and treatment of asthma , especially in children .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The available very low to low quality evidence does not confirm or rule out beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The DASH diet was found to be effective in reducing C-reactive protein ( CRP ) levels in type 2 diabetics .
It was also found to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease .
There was no significant difference in the effect of the DASH versus control diet on fasting glucose , fasting plasma glucose , or A1C levels .
In addition , there was no difference in fasting plasma triglyceride levels , fasting fasting insulin , or fasting fasting glucose .
However , there were no significant differences in the effects of DASH and control diets on HDL-cholesterol levels , and there was a significant difference between the two groups in fasting glucose and fasting insulin .
Conclusion The Dietary Approaches to Stop

There is insufficient data to draw conclusions about the efficacy of these drugs on glycemic control in patients who are not inadequately control by metformins
INFO:root:Reference summary: Initial combination therapy with DPP-IV inhibitors more effectively reduced MAGE than stepwise add-on therapies ( p = 0.006 ) , although no differences in MAGE were found based on HbA1c values .
These findings indicate that DPP-IV inhibitors are promising alternatives for reducing GV in type 2 diabetes patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this review suggest that physical activity training is effective in improving the physical capacity of individuals with spinal cord injury .
In addition , it is possible to improve physical capacity by increasing the intensity of physical activity .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of physical exercise training on physical capacity in individuals with SCI .
However , there is some evidence to support the use of low-intensity physical activity in SCI rehabilitation .

However , there is remarkably little research , particularly for individuals who do not have spinal-cord injury
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the role of childhood trauma in the development of PTSD .
However , the evidence suggests that childhood trauma is associated with an increased risk of developing PTSD in later life .
In addition , childhood trauma may be associated with a greater likelihood of developing posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
There is limited evidence to support a relationship between childhood trauma and subsequent PTSD in adults .
Conclusions Children with childhood trauma are more likely to develop PTSD than children without childhood trauma .

INFO:root:Reference summary: Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with mCRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications .
PATIENT SUMMARY In men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only , it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since survival and quality of life may never be affected in many of these patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of magnification lenses in dental education .
However , the evidence suggests that using magnification lenses may have a positive effect on the clinical posture of dental students .
In addition , it is unclear whether the effect of the lenses on the patient 's posture is similar to that of traditional safety glasses .
There is limited evidence to suggest that the effects of the magnification lenses on patient ' posture are similar to those of safety glasses , but there is some evidence that the effect is less pronounced when the lenses are used with a Bambach Saddle Seat .
INFO:root:Reference summary: CONCLUSIONS Based on a limited number of studies , the use of ergonomic saddle seats and dental loupes leads to improved working postures .
The use of loupes appears to relieve shoulder , arm and h and pain .
However , their effect on neck pain is scarce .
None of the studies reported on the effect of the saddle seats on musculoskeletal pain .

Glycerine filled insoles may be a promising option for improving balance in people with balance impairment .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the long-term effects of these insoles on walking performance .
There is limited evidence to support the use of these types of insoles to improve balance , gait , and walking performance in individuals with balance disorders .

A limited level of evidence exists in favour of using insoles over anti-fatigue mats .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence for a positive association between childhood adversities and physical health outcomes in later life .
There is strong evidence that children and adolescents with early-onset mental disorders are more likely to be at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and other chronic diseases .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between these outcomes and social factors .
Conclusions Children and adolescents who have been exposed to adverse childhood experiences may be at greater risk for developing cardiovascular diseases .
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Bariatric surgery is associated with significant improvements in the pharmacokinetics of some drugs , but not all .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of bariatric surgery on the pharmacodynamics of other drugs .
The results of this review suggest that bariatric surgical procedures may have a beneficial effect on pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with severe obesity .
Bariatric surgery may be associated with an increase in amoxicillin bioavailability , but the effect on other drugs is unclear .
In addition , there is limited evidence to support the use of surgery for the prevention of cardiovascular disease .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Patients given oral beta-lactams and macrolides warrant close monitoring due to unpredictable absorption post-bariatric surgery , whereas oral fluoroquinolones and linezolid may not be affected .
Several studies also showed decreased absorption following RYGB , as well as lower serum exposure in patients with obesity compared to non-obese controls .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of progestin as a first-line treatment for depression in postmenopausal women .
In addition , the current evidence suggests that progestins are associated with an increased risk of developing depression in older women .
INFO:root:Reference summary: This moderate to large effect size , showing lower ratings of depressed mood in treated patients compared with controls , implicated HRT as a potential treatment of or prophylactic for depression in menopausal women .
One can generalize from the studies review ed here only with great caution , but there is little evidence to support the use of estradiol to improve mood in nondepressed patients ( not surprisingly ) and some evidence to support the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal women

There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of these interventions in improving physical function and health status in frail elderly adults .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion Frequency of 1–6 sessions per week , training volume of 1–3 sets of 6–15 repetitions and intensity of 30–70%1-RM promoted significant enhancements on muscle strength , muscle power , and functional outcomes .
Therefore , in agreement with previous studies , we suggest that supervised and controlled RT represents an effective intervention in frailty treatment
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of immediate ADT for the detection of PCa in men with PCa .
The current evidence suggests that immediate or delayed ADT is associated with an increased risk of death .
However , the current evidence does not support its use as a first-line treatment for PCa
INFO:root:Reference summary: Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy .
PSA doubling time in < 3 yr or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention .
In men with locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not m and atory , watchful waiting ( WW ) is a treatment alternative to and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) with equivalent oncologic efficacy .
Active treatment is mostly recommended for patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy  with  radical prostatectomy ( RP ) shown to be superior to WW in a prospect i ve r and omised trial .
Nerve-sparing RP represents the approach of choice in organ
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , resveratrol supplementation with calcium fructoborate is effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with stable angina pectoris .
In addition , the combination of calcium fibrinogen with resvatrol may be effective in improving insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of resveratinol supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk factors .

Significant improvement in inflammatory markers  support resveratrol as an adjunct to pharmacologic management of metabolic diseases
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) may be effective in reducing weight gain in people with schizophrenia .
Cognitive behavioural therapy may be an effective strategy for reducing weight in patients with schizophrenia who have been treated with antipsychotic drugs .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results The results of the meta- analysis show an effect toward the experimental group .
Notably , prevention studies with individual psychoeducational programmes that include diet and /or physical activity seem to have the highest impact .
Conclusions When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and individual lifestyle interventions that include diet and physical activity generally prove to be effective in reducing weight .
This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion : Resveratrol is effective in improving glycemic control in patients with T2DM .
It is safe to assume that it may be effective in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes , but there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about its efficacy .
The current evidence suggests that the effects of resveratol on glucose metabolism and glycaemic control are not clear .
In conclusion , the current evidence supports the use of the polyphenols as a first-line therapy for improving glycemia and insulin sensitivity in T2D patients
INFO:root:Reference summary: The drug also reduced homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) index , systolic blood pressure , and diastolic blood pressure among participants with T2DM .
The changes in hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negligible .
Subgroup analysis comparing the resveratrol supplementation doses of < 100 mg/d versus ≥ 100 mg/d revealed a significant difference in fasting plasma glucose .

However , there is some evidence that dairy consumption is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease in children and adolescents than in adults .
There is also evidence that low-fat dairy consumption may be associated with an increased risk of heart disease , stroke , and diabetes .
In conclusion , dairy consumption appears to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease risk in children , adolescents , and adults
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results of the analysis indicated that increased consumption of unsaturated fats , fruits , vegetables and low-fat dietary products  , decreased consumption of dietary sodium and beverages containing caffeine , and breastfeeding were found to have preventive effects against high blood pressure in later years of life .
The effects of training given during youth to encourage a healthy lifestyle and behavior changes based on diet and physical activity were also noted
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of lactulose supplementation for the prevention of C and ida colonization in preterm infants .
However , the evidence is insufficient to support its use for the treatment of other infectious diseases , such as sepsis .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In RCTs , pasteurized human donor milk , as opposed to formula , reduced NEC but not infections or mortality .
Pooled data of small trials and a recent large RCT suggested that bovine lactoferrin reduced rates of fungal sepsis without impact on other infections , NEC , or mortality .
Pooled data of RCTs assessing the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides found reduced infection but not mortality .
A meta- analysis sensitivity approach found multiple-strain ( but not single-strain ) probiotics to be highly effective in reducing NEC and mortality .
Thus , selected food components may help to improve outcomes in preterm infants
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of task shifting interventions to reduce health inequity or population vulnerability .
However , the evidence suggests that task shifting may be effective in reducing health inequities and population vulnerability in the short-term , but not in the long-term .
Task shifting interventions may reduce the risk of disease recurrence , but they may not improve health outcomes .
There is limited evidence to suggest that there is a positive effect of the intervention on health equity and population vulnerabilities .
The evidence for the effectiveness of the task shifting intervention is inconclusive , but the evidence for its effectiveness in reducing disease risk and improving health outcomes is limited .
Conclusion : Task shifting interventions are effective in improving health

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this review suggest that the use of coloured filters may be effective in improving the behaviour of children with visual impairment .
However , the evidence is limited and the results of the present review are inconclusive .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of coloured-filter systems on the behavior of individuals with visual impairments .
INFO:root:Reference summary: While many studies report improvements with coloured lenses , the effect size is generally small and /or similar to the improvement found with a placebo condition .
Consistent with previous review s and advice from several professional bodies , we conclude that the use of coloured lenses or overlays to ameliorate reading difficulties can not be endorsed and that any benefits reported by individuals in clinical setting s are likely to be the result of placebo , practice or Hawthorne effects
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of preoperative warming for the prevention of SSIs after colorectal surgery .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that methylpheni date is associated with a significant increase in dopamine levels in the ventral striatum compared with placebo .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about its effects on other brain regions in ADHD patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS The fMRI analysis showed that methylpheni date significantly enhanced activation in bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC)/insula during inhibition and time discrimination but had no effect on working memory networks .
The meta- analysis , including 14 fMRI data sets and 212 children with ADHD , showed that stimulants most consistently enhanced right IFC/insula activation , which also remained for a subgroup analysis of methylpheni date effects alone .
A more lenient threshold also revealed increased putamen activation .
CONCLUSIONS Psychostimulants most consistently increase right IFC/insula activation , which are key areas of cognitive control and also the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD .
These neurocognitive effects may underlie their positive clinical
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that PYC supplementation is effective in reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in humans .
PYC significantly reduces the levels of both COX-1 and CRP .
In conclusion , PYC is an effective antioxidant that may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease .
The results suggest that the use of PYC may have a beneficial effect on oxidative stress in humans

INFO:root:Reference summary: Because of the heterogeneity and the limited number of studies , there is no sufficient evidence on the potential role of vasomotor symptoms in metabolic health .
However , both high- quality cohort studies , with large study population s and adjustment for multiple confounding variables showed positive associations between vasomotor symptoms and insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus .
These findings suggest that there is an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic health outcomes .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there was no significant difference between the two methods for the reconstruction of leg length and global and femoral offset in THA .
There is no clear evidence that either method is superior to the other in terms of the recovery rate .
However , there is some evidence that the use of the imaging technique is superior in the long-term outcomes of THA
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results Significant differences were found in the femoral offset and overall complication rate between the conventional and navigation groups .
Additionally , the conventional group had significantly less anteversion than the navigation group .
However , the navigation group had significantly better inclination .
The operation time was significantly shorter in the conventional than navigation group .
Conclusion Both the OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional total hip arthroplasty result in significant improvements in patient function with similar overall complication rates and have their own advantages in achieving good cup position .
The conventional procedure has a shorter operation time than does use of a navigation system
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis suggests that the use of monetary incentives may be effective in increasing the return rate for TB skin test reading among drug users .
However , the evidence is limited to a small number of studies , and it is unclear whether monetary incentives are effective in reducing the risk of developing TB .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours .
Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that probiotic supplementation may have a beneficial effect on glycemic control and weight gain in women with GDM .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of probiotics on other metabolic parameters .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Among secondary endpoints , a significant reduction of maternal insulin ( both in women with or without diabetes ) was observed in the probiotics group .
INTERPRETATION Probiotics during pregnancy do not reduce the incidence of GDM , with a very little ( statistically but not clinical ly significant ) reduction of fasting plasma glucose
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that bezafibrate is associated with a significant reduction in serum IGF-I and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels , but not with other markers of insulin resistance .
In conclusion , the effects of fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids on serum insulin-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) are not associated with changes in plasma insulin levels .
However , there is evidence to suggest that fibrate may have an effect on plasma insulin concentrations .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that the use of Serenoa repens for the treatment of LUTS is associated with a significant improvement in Qmax , Qmed and PVR in patients with BPH .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of Serenea repen on other urinary symptoms .
The use of the extract for the management of LutS is not associated with an improvement in other symptoms .
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that long-term iodine prophylaxis may reduce the risk of MTF in children and adolescents .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of long- term iodine supplementation on cognitive performance in children .
There is limited evidence that iodine supplementation is associated with an improvement in cognitive performance .
Conclusions Long-term iodized salt supplementation appears to be associated with a significant improvement in cognition in children , adolescents and adults .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that NF may be an effective treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents .
However , there is insufficient evidence to conclude that NF is superior to other treatments for the treatment of ADHD
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .

Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis of ≥24 hours may be more efficacious in preventing sternal SSIs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to shorter regimens .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Metformin is associated with an increase in homocysteine and folate levels in patients with type 2 diabetes , but not with vitamin B12 levels .
Metformin does not appear to have a significant effect on vitamin B-12 concentrations in patients without diabetes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Therefore , although the overall effect of metformin on the concentration of serum Hcy was neutral , our results suggested that metformin could increase the concentration of Hcy when exogenous B-group vitamins or folic acid supplementation was not given
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that MUFA supplementation may be effective in improving glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity in subjects with high fasting triglyceride concentrations .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of MUFA on insulin sensitivity .
MUFAs appear to have a beneficial effect on glucose and insulin levels .
There is limited evidence to support the use of MUFAs to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose control in patients at high risk of developing diabetes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In contrast , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not affected by the amounts of MUFA in the dietary protocol s. Conclusions : In summary , this systematic review found that high MUFA diets appear to be effective in reducing HbA1c , and therefore , should be recommended in the dietary regimes of T2D
INFO:root:Generated summary: Preoperative physical training is effective in reducing the incidence of PPCs in patients at high risk of developing pulmonary complications after CABG surgery .
Preoperative exercise training may reduce the risk of pulmonary complications in high-risk patients .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of preoperative physical therapy in preventing pulmonary complications .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant association between total protein intake and the risk of hip fracture .
Conclusions This review provides evidence that high-protein diets are associated with a lower risk of fracture in older adults .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of dairy on hip fracture risk .
There is limited evidence that low-protein and high-fat diets have an effect on fracture risk
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions The use of hydrolyzed protein formula is effective in improving gastrointestinal motility in preterm infants with feeding intolerance .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of a hydrolysate formula for the treatment of GER .
The use of an eHPF may be effective in reducing the risk of developing GER in these infants .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding preterm infants  with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .
The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with protein hydrolysate affects the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .

Conclusions : Our review had insufficient power to exclude clinical ly important effects of education on mortality and morbidity .
INFO:root:Generated summary: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pedometer-based physical activity interventions to increase walking cadence in adults .
Pedometers may be an effective tool for increasing walking activity in adults , but they may not be effective in increasing walking intensity or walking duration .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity

In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the association between leptin and prostate cancer risk .
There is no strong evidence that leptin is associated with risk of prostate cancer
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The current evidence does not suggest an association between leptin and PCa outcome .
However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Our results suggest that oral vitamin C is safe and effective in the prevention of colds and other common colds .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of large doses of vitamin C for the treatment of the common cold .
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .

A limited level of evidence exists in favour of using insoles over anti-fatigue mats .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that social factors are associated with an increased risk of developing a range of chronic physical and mental health conditions in later life .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between social factors and physical health .
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Bariatric surgery is associated with significant improvements in the pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics .
The effects of bariatric surgery on amoxicillin are not clear .
However , there is evidence that the effects of surgery on the absorption of antibiotics may be greater in patients who are obese .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Patients given oral beta-lactams and macrolides warrant close monitoring due to unpredictable absorption post-bariatric surgery , whereas oral fluoroquinolones and linezolid may not be affected .
Several studies also showed decreased absorption following RYGB , as well as lower serum exposure in patients with obesity compared to non-obese controls .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that the use of progestin is associated with an increase in negative mood and physical symptoms in postmenopausal women .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of estrogen on these outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: This moderate to large effect size , showing lower ratings of depressed mood in treated patients compared with controls , implicated HRT as a potential treatment of or prophylactic for depression in menopausal women .
One can generalize from the studies review ed here only with great caution , but there is little evidence to support the use of estradiol to improve mood in nondepressed patients ( not surprisingly ) and some evidence to support the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal women

INFO:root:Reference summary: Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy .
PSA doubling time in < 3 yr or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention .
In men with locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not m and atory , watchful waiting ( WW ) is a treatment alternative to and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) with equivalent oncologic efficacy .
Active treatment is mostly recommended for patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy  with  radical prostatectomy ( RP ) shown to be superior to WW in a prospect i ve r and omised trial .
Nerve-sparing RP represents the approach of choice in organ

The results of this review suggest that CBT may be an effective strategy for reducing weight loss in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results The results of the meta- analysis show an effect toward the experimental group .
Notably , prevention studies with individual psychoeducational programmes that include diet and /or physical activity seem to have the highest impact .
Conclusions When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and individual lifestyle interventions that include diet and physical activity generally prove to be effective in reducing weight .
This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone .

There was no significant difference between the two groups in the number of children with ADHD .
No significant differences were found in the length of follow-up or in the quality of life of the children .
Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that early identification of children at risk of developing ADHD is associated with better long-term outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results suggest there is moderate-to-high-level evidence that combined pharmacological and behavioral interventions , and pharmacological interventions alone can be effective in managing the core ADHD symptoms and academic performance at 14 months .
However , the effect size may decrease beyond this period .
This review has highlighted the paucity and limitations of the evidence investigating the long-term outcomes of recommended interventions for managing ADHD symptoms .
There is little evidence to suggest that the effects observed over the relatively short term are maintained throughout longer periods of impairment .

However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of ATX on other aspects of the brain function in ADHD .
In addition , the results of the meta-analyses suggest that ATX may not be superior to other stimulants in terms of improving attention or executive functioning .
Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the beneficial effects of stimulants on the brain in ADHD treatment .
The results suggest that stimulants may have a role in improving attention , executive functioning , and motivation in the brain of ADHD patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS The fMRI analysis showed that methylpheni date significantly enhanced activation in bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC)/insula during inhibition and time discrimination but had no effect on working memory networks .
The meta- analysis , including 14 fMRI data sets and 212 children with ADHD , showed that stimulants most consistently enhanced right IFC/insula activation , which also remained for a subgroup analysis of methylpheni date effects alone .
A more lenient threshold also revealed increased putamen activation .
CONCLUSIONS Psychostimulants most consistently increase right IFC/insula activation , which are key areas of cognitive control and also the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD .
These neurocognitive effects may underlie their positive clinical

Conclusion Both the OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional total hip arthroplasty result in significant improvements in patient function with similar overall complication rates and have their own advantages in achieving good cup position .
The conventional procedure has a shorter operation time than does use of a navigation system
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that monetary incentives were effective in increasing the rate of return for tuberculosis skin test reading and reducing the incidence of positive tuberculin test results .
However , there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the number of positive TB test results or in the prevalence of positive tuberculosis test result .
Conclusions These results suggest that the use of monetary incentives may have a small effect on the return rate of TB skin test readings .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of monetary interventions on the incidence and prevalence of TB .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours .
Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that probiotic supplementation is effective in improving glycemic control and weight gain in pregnant women with GDM .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of probiotics for the prevention of weight gain or weight loss in GDM
INFO:root:Reference summary: Among secondary endpoints , a significant reduction of maternal insulin ( both in women with or without diabetes ) was observed in the probiotics group .
INTERPRETATION Probiotics during pregnancy do not reduce the incidence of GDM , with a very little ( statistically but not clinical ly significant ) reduction of fasting plasma glucose
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , bezafibrate therapy is associated with a significant reduction in serum IGF-I levels , but not with changes in plasma glucose homeostasis parameters .
However , there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the effect of fibrates on serum insulin levels is independent of the type of treatment .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : This meta‐ analysis has shown that fibrate treatment  significantly decreases fasting plasma glucose , insulin levels , and HOMA‐IR indicating additional clinical therapeutic benefits .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence for the reliability and validity of the Cronbach Scale for the assessment of mental health and weight-related attitudes and behaviors in the United States .
The Cronbach scale is an effective tool for measuring the psychological and social attitudes of individuals with mental health disorders .
It is a useful tool for assessing the attitudes and behaviours of people with mental illness .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Most question naires were brief , demonstrated adequate internal consistency , and tapped key cognitive and affective dimensions of weight bias such as stereotypes and blaming .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence that nonoperative treatment of acute appendicitis with antibiotics is safe and cost-effective compared with surgical treatment in children .
INFO:root:Reference summary: With significantly higher efficacy and low complication rates , appendectomy remains the most effective treatment for patients with uncomplicated AA .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that the use of Serenoa repens for the treatment of LUTS is associated with a significant improvement in Qmax , Qmed and PVR in patients with BPH .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of the treatment on erectile function or urinary symptoms .
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that iodine supplementation is effective in improving cognitive performance in children who are mildly to moderately iodine-deficient .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of long-term iodine prophylaxis for the prevention of MTF in children .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that NF is effective in reducing hyperactivity in children and adolescents with ADHD .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of NF as an adjunctive treatment in adults with ADHD
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Compared with haloperidol , olanzapine is superior in terms of efficacy , tolerability and safety in the treatment of bipolar disorder .
However , there was no significant difference in the quality of life of patients taking the drug compared with those taking placebo .
The efficacy and safety profile of the new antipsychotic drugs olanza and risperidone was not significantly different from that of the conventional antipsychotics .
There was no difference between the two drugs in the duration of remission of manic episodes in bipolar disorder patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for  acute mania .
From the limited data available , there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone .
Some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole .
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference in the rate of recurrence of AF after catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after a first procedure .
There is no evidence to support the use of AF ablation in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea .
Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis of r and omized controlled trials suggests that catheter ablative ablation is safe and effective in the prevention of AF recurrence .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend catheter-based ablation for patients with OSA
INFO:root:Reference summary: Dilated LA significantly increases the risk of AF recurrence after  single CPVI .
This is especially applicable to the patients with long-term follow-up
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that single-dose cefazolin prophylaxis is effective in preventing surgical site infections after cardiac surgery .
However , there was no significant difference in the incidence of surgical site infection between the two groups .
There is no evidence to support the use of multiple doses of cefzolin in cardiac surgery
INFO:root:Reference summary: There were no statistically significant differences in mortality , infections overall and adverse events .
Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis of ≥24 hours may be more efficacious in preventing sternal SSIs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to shorter regimens .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Metformin therapy is associated with an increase in serum homocysteine , folate and vitamin B12 concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that metformin treatment may be associated with a small but significant increase in the levels of folate , B12 , and homocystine .
However , it is unclear whether this effect is independent of the duration of treatment .
Conclusions Compared with placebo , the results of the meta-analyses suggest that long-term treatment with metformins may increase serum folate concentrations and may also increase homocystenine concentrations .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Therefore , although the overall effect of metformin on the concentration of serum Hcy was neutral , our results suggested that metformin could increase the concentration of Hcy when exogenous B-group vitamins or folic acid supplementation was not given
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that MUFA-based diets may be effective in improving glycaemic control in subjects with high fasting glucose and insulin concentrations .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of MUFA supplementation on other parameters of glycemic control
INFO:root:Reference summary: In contrast , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not affected by the amounts of MUFA in the dietary protocol s. Conclusions : In summary , this systematic review found that high MUFA diets appear to be effective in reducing HbA1c , and therefore , should be recommended in the dietary regimes of T2D
INFO:root:Generated summary: Preoperative physical training is effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative PPCs in patients at high risk of developing a PPC after CABG surgery .
Preoperative PT may be an effective prophylactic strategy to prevent the occurrence of post-operative pulmonary complications in high-risk patients
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant association between total protein intake and the risk of hip fracture in the Framingham Original Cohort .
Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that high-protein diets are associated with a lower risk of fracture in older adults .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of dairy consumption on fracture risk in the general population .
The results of this systematic review suggest that the consumption of dairy products may be beneficial for the prevention of fracture .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Hydrolyzed protein formula is effective in improving gastrointestinal motility in preterm infants with symptoms of feeding intolerance .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of hydrolysate protein formula for improving GI motility .
Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed no significant difference between hydrolyzed and non-hydroxybutyrate protein formulas in improving GI symptoms of GER .
The results of this systematic review suggest that hydrolysated protein formula may be effective in reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms of preterm infantile gastroenteritis .
There is no evidence to support the recommendation of using hydrolysates as a treatment for gastroenterological symptoms of GI intolerance
INFO:root:Reference summary: The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding preterm infants  with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .
The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with protein hydrolysate affects the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis showed no significant difference between the intervention groups for systolic and diastolic BP .
Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the effectiveness of community-based lifestyle interventions in reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in low-income developing countries .
The results suggest that community based lifestyle interventions may be an effective strategy to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and improve the quality of life of patients in these countries
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions There is a dearth of evidence on the implementation of task-shifting strategies to reduce the burden of CVD in LMICs .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that PBL interventions are effective in improving QoL in patients with acute myocardial infa rct ion after discharge from hospital .
However , there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of physical activity or quality of life .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was evidence to suggest that education can improve HRQoL and decrease healthcare costs by reductions in downstream healthcare utilization .
Conclusions : Our review had insufficient power to exclude clinical ly important effects of education on mortality and morbidity .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence for the effectiveness of pedometer-based physical activity interventions in increasing walking cadence in adults .
The results suggest that pedometers may be effective in improving walking performance and reducing the risk of stroke , but not in improving blood pressure or heart rate .
Pedometers may also improve walking performance in children and adolescents .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of pedometers in adults for increasing walking performance or reducing blood pressure
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant association between adiponectin and the risk of developing incident prostate cancer .
In conclusion , the current meta- analysis suggests that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) levels are associated with an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer in overweight and obese men .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the association of leptin with high- grade prostate cancer risk
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The current evidence does not suggest an association between leptin and PCa outcome .
However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Our meta- analysis suggests that vitamin C is safe and effective in the prevention and treatment of colds and flu .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of large doses of vitamin C in the prophylactic treatment of the common cold .
Vitamin C is effective in preventing and treating colds , but not in the treatment of flu .
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The RMQ has been shown to be sensitive to changes in the quality of life of patients with low back pain .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the RMQ as an independent measure of patient change in clinical trials .
Conclusions The RMQ is a useful instrument for assessing the quality -of-life of patients who are undergoing treatment for low back and hip pain .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options .
Negative changes were not associated with larger ESs .
Population -based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with smaller ESs , and acute conditions with larger ESs .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence that cannabis use is associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the severity of psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia and related disorders .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of cannabis use on clinical outcomes .
The results of this systematic review suggest that the association between cannabis use and clinical outcomes is not consistent across studies .
Conclusions The current evidence does not support the use of cannabis as a predictor of clinical outcomes in schizophrenia .
INFO:root:Reference summary: INTERPRETATION Continued cannabis use after onset of psychosis predicts adverse outcome , including higher relapse rates , longer hospital admissions , and more severe positive symptoms than for individuals who discontinue cannabis use and those who are non-users .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that iron supplementation is safe and effective in the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of intravenous iron as an adjuvant to erythropoietin or erythrocyte reticulocyte colony-stimulating agents ( ESA ) in PD patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: High-dose parenteral iron does not seem to be associated with higher risk of infection , all-cause mortality , increased hospitalization or increased cardiovascular events on analysis of RCTs .
Observational studies show increased risk for all-cause mortality , infections and hospitalizations that were not statistically significant and were associated with significant heterogeneity
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Our meta- analysis showed that weight loss is associated with significant reductions in serum insulin and CRP concentrations in obese subjects .
The results of this meta‐ analysis support the hypothesis that a weight loss diet is effective in reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects and may be a promising strategy for achieving weight loss in this population
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS Weight loss was associated with a decline in CRP level .
Our results suggest that weight loss may be an effective nonpharmacologic strategy for lowering CRP level
INFO:root:Generated summary: The six studies reported in the current meta- analysis showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of femoral component migration , rotations , or femoral head penetration .
In conclusion , there is no evidence to support the use of cemented total hip arthroplasty in the short term or in the long term
INFO:root:Reference summary: INTERPRETATION There was a clinical ly relevant association between early migration of acetabular cups  and late revision due to loosening .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Preterm infants and children with preterm birth appear to have different language development trajectories compared with full-term infants .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between language development and neuropsychological outcomes in preterm infants or children
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS : Preterm-born children scored significantly lower compared with term-born children on simple ( d = –0.45 [ 95 % CI : –0.59 to –0.30 ] ; P < .001 ) and on complex ( d = –0.62 [ 95 % CI : –0.82 to –0.43 ] ; P < .001 ) language function tests , even in the absence of major disabilities and independent of social economic status .
: While growing up , preterm-born children have increasing difficulties with complex language function
INFO:root:Generated summary: Vitamin D supplementation does not appear to be associated with an increase in the risk of all-cause mortality in children with asthma or any other chronic disease .
The available evidence suggests that vitamin D supplementation may be effective in reducing the incidence of asthma and other chronic diseases in children and adolescents .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The available very low to low quality evidence does not confirm or rule out beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The DASH diet was found to be effective in reducing C-reactive protein ( CRP ) levels in type 2 diabetic patients .
However , there was no significant difference in the effect of the diet on other biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk .
Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that the DASH dietary pattern was effective in lowering CRP levels in diabetic patients with type 2 diabetes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The DASH dietary pattern may lead to an improvement in insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss .
The DASH diet may play an important role in glycemic control in long- term interventions .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors are effective in reducing glycemic variability in patients with T2DM who are inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy
INFO:root:Reference summary: Initial combination therapy with DPP-IV inhibitors more effectively reduced MAGE than stepwise add-on therapies ( p = 0.006 ) , although no differences in MAGE were found based on HbA1c values .
These findings indicate that DPP-IV inhibitors are promising alternatives for reducing GV in type 2 diabetes patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence that low-intensity physical activity training is effective in improving physical capacity in individuals with spinal cord injury .
The results of this systematic review suggest that low intensity physical exercise training may be beneficial in improving the physical capacity of individuals with SCI .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of low intensity training in the rehabilitation of SCI patients
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : Exercise training programs seem to be effective in improving wheelchair propulsion capacity .
However , there is remarkably little research , particularly for individuals who do not have spinal-cord injury
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the prevalence of PTSD .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between childhood trauma and subsequent trauma in adults with SCI .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : Combinations of peri- and post-injury factors appear to be influential in the development of PTSD among persons with SCI .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions The current meta- analysis showed no significant difference in BCR-free survival between immediate ADT and delayed ADT in patients with pT3pN0 , R0-R1 PCa .
There was no difference between immediate and deferred ADT .
In patients with PSA > 50 ng/ml , aRT was associated with a significantly lower risk of PSA doubling time ( PSADT > 12 mo ) compared with no ADT , and with a shorter time to PSA relapse ( > 2 mo ) .
However , there was a significant difference between aRT and delayed and deferred APT in PSA-deteriorating PSA .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with mCRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications .
PATIENT SUMMARY In men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only , it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since survival and quality of life may never be affected in many of these patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that the use of magnification loupes may have a positive effect on the patient-centred posture of dental students .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of magnification lenses on the clinical performance of the patient .
The results suggest that using magnification lenses may have an effect on patient-centered behaviour in dental education .
INFO:root:Reference summary: CONCLUSIONS Based on a limited number of studies , the use of ergonomic saddle seats and dental loupes leads to improved working postures .
The use of loupes appears to relieve shoulder , arm and h and pain .
However , their effect on neck pain is scarce .
None of the studies reported on the effect of the saddle seats on musculoskeletal pain .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis showed that MTA is superior to formocresol in terms of clinical and radiographic success rate , but not in the short-term outcomes .
MTA was superior to FC in the long-term outcome of pulpotomy in primary molars with carious pulp exposure .
In addition , MTA was superior in the treatment of root resorption , root canal obliteration and post-treatment disease .
Conclusion MTA is an effective and safe alternative material for pulpotomized primary molar teeth .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : Primary molars pulpotomy with MTA have better clinical and radiographic success rates than FC . (
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that there is no evidence to support the use of glycerine-filled insoles for balance and gait performance in patients with balance impairments .
However , there is some evidence to suggest that these insoles may improve the performance of balance tests in people with balance impairment .
INFO:root:Reference summary: A moderate level of evidence was found in support of using cushioned material s in reducing discomfort/fatigue among st and ing workers .
A limited level of evidence exists in favour of using insoles over anti-fatigue mats .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis provides evidence that childhood adversities are associated with an increased risk of developing a range of chronic physical and mental health conditions in later life .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between these factors and physical health outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Bariatric surgery is associated with significant improvements in the pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics , especially amoxicillin and moxifloxacin .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that bariatric surgery may have a beneficial effect on the absorption of antibiotics .
However , the effects of surgery on the bioavailability of antibiotics are not clear .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Patients given oral beta-lactams and macrolides warrant close monitoring due to unpredictable absorption post-bariatric surgery , whereas oral fluoroquinolones and linezolid may not be affected .
Several studies also showed decreased absorption following RYGB , as well as lower serum exposure in patients with obesity compared to non-obese controls .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that estrogen therapy is associated with an increase in negative mood and physical symptoms in postmenopausal women with premenstrual syndrome .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of estrogen alone or in combination with progestin for the treatment of depressive symptoms in older women
INFO:root:Reference summary: This moderate to large effect size , showing lower ratings of depressed mood in treated patients compared with controls , implicated HRT as a potential treatment of or prophylactic for depression in menopausal women .
One can generalize from the studies review ed here only with great caution , but there is little evidence to support the use of estradiol to improve mood in nondepressed patients ( not surprisingly ) and some evidence to support the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal women
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 supplementation is effective in reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract infections in infants and young children .
The results suggest that the use of probiotics may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of these infections in the short term .
INFO:root:Reference summary: We found no evidence to support a protective association between perinatal use of probiotics and doctor diagnosed asthma or childhood wheeze .
R and omised controlled trials to date have not yielded sufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the primary prevention of these disorders .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of kinematics .
However , there was a significant difference in the incidence of radiolucency in the mobile bearing group compared with the fixed bearing group .
There was no difference in tibial internal rotation between the groups .
INFO:root:Reference summary: After stratification on follow-up time and age , the revision rates were not substantially different , aside for younger patients in short term from studies with short-term follow-up .
Conclusion No essential differences between the two design s were observed .
MB and FB UKA design s have comparable revision rates .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the effectiveness of structured exercise interventions for the management of frailty in community-dwelling older adults .
The results of this systematic review suggest that structured exercise programs may be effective in improving physical function and improving health status in older adults
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion Frequency of 1–6 sessions per week , training volume of 1–3 sets of 6–15 repetitions and intensity of 30–70%1-RM promoted significant enhancements on muscle strength , muscle power , and functional outcomes .
Therefore , in agreement with previous studies , we suggest that supervised and controlled RT represents an effective intervention in frailty treatment
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of all-cause mortality .
There were no significant differences in the rate of death from all causes .
No significant differences were found in the number of complications .
Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that the use of immediate ADT in PCa is not associated with a significant increase in the risk of PCa death .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy .
PSA doubling time in < 3 yr or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention .
In men with locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not m and atory , watchful waiting ( WW ) is a treatment alternative to and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) with equivalent oncologic efficacy .
Active treatment is mostly recommended for patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy  with  radical prostatectomy ( RP ) shown to be superior to WW in a prospect i ve r and omised trial .
Nerve-sparing RP represents the approach of choice in organ
INFO:root:Generated summary: Resveratrol supplementation with calcium fructoborate is effective in improving insulin sensitivity in patients with stable angina pectoris .
The results of the present meta- analysis suggest that resveratol supplementation may be effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients who are at high risk of developing cardiovascular events .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of resveratinol supplementation on cardiovascular events
INFO:root:Reference summary: IMPLICATION S Available evidence from RCTs suggests that resveratrol supplementation significantly reduced TNF-α and hs-CRP levels .
Significant improvement in inflammatory markers  support resveratrol as an adjunct to pharmacologic management of metabolic diseases
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) may be effective in reducing weight gain in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of CBT for weight loss in patients who have been treated with antipsychotic drugs .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results The results of the meta- analysis show an effect toward the experimental group .
Notably , prevention studies with individual psychoeducational programmes that include diet and /or physical activity seem to have the highest impact .
Conclusions When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and individual lifestyle interventions that include diet and physical activity generally prove to be effective in reducing weight .
This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that MTA is effective in the treatment of carious-exposed pulp exposures in young permanent teeth .
The results of this systematic review suggest that MTA may be an effective and cost-effective treatment option for the prevention and treatment of pulpal exposures by caries .
However , the available evidence does not support the use of MTA in the management of caries in permanent teeth
INFO:root:Reference summary: Vital permanent teeth with cariously exposed pulp can be treated successfully with vital pulp therapy .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis showed that prophylactic radiofrequency ablation of the ventricular Tachycardia and VF in patients with structural heart disease is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence of both VF and VT .
However , there was no significant difference in the survival rate between the two groups .
The cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency catheter ablation is not clear .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Noninducibility of VT after VT ablation is associated with improved arrhythmia-free survival and all-cause mortality
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the failure rate .
The results of the present meta- analysis showed that the in vitro shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets is comparable to that of the in vivo study .
However , there is no difference in the in-vivo survival rate of the two in vitro studies .
There is no evidence to support the use of a different type of bonding material for the same type of bracket in vivo
INFO:root:Reference summary: Many studies on in-vitro orthodontic bond strength fail to report test conditions that could significantly affect their outcomes
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis of the available evidence supports the use of antihypertensive drugs in the management of high blood pressure in older adults with diabetes or CKD .
There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of diuretics for the treatment of high BP
INFO:root:Reference summary: Strict control [ systolic BP ( SBP ) < 140 mmHg ] was not consistently better than mild control ( SBP < 150 mmHg ) for adults aged ≥65 years .
Mild SBP control benefitted subjects in all age ranges over 65 years .
Conclusions In this review , older adults with hypertension had decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  with antihypertensives compared with no treatment .
Strict control was not consistently better than mild control in older adults .
The current evidence is insufficient to determine the safest , most beneficial hypertension regimen in older adults
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that fluoxetine may be an effective prophylactic treatment for migraine .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about its efficacy and safety .
Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analyses suggest that antidepressants may be effective in the prevention of migraine attacks .
Although the current evidence base does not support the use of antidepressants for the treatment of migraine
INFO:root:Reference summary: Over 2 months of treatment , SSRIs are no more efficacious than placebo in patients with migraine .
In patients with chronic TTH , SSRIs are less efficacious than tricyclic antidepressants .
In comparison with SSRIs , the burden of adverse events in patients receiving tricyclics was greater .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Our meta- analysis showed that the consumption of SSSDs is associated with an increase in total body weight , BMI , body mass index ( BMI ) and waist circumference , as well as with a decrease in serum triglyceride levels .
SSSDs are associated with a significant increase in body weight and BMI , but not with other markers of adiposity .
Conclusions The consumption of sucrose-sweetened soft drinks , especially those containing high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) , has been shown to increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome .
The consumption of these products may be associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome , but the evidence is inconclusive .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Subgroup analyses showed the most marked relation between sugar intakes and lipids in studies in which efforts were made to ensure an energy balance and when no difference in weight change was reported .
CONCLUSIONS Dietary sugars  influence blood pressure and serum lipids .
The relation is independent of effects of  sugars on body weight .

This meta- analysis provides evidence that supplementation of resveratrol may benefit management of T2DM
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis showed no significant differences between the three polishing systems in terms of surface roughness and microhardness .
In conclusion , the results suggest that the polishing of nanocomposites does not significantly affect the micro-hardness or micro-staining of the surfaces of the composites .
However , there is a lack of evidence to support the use of a single polishing system for the microhardening of the composite surfaces .
Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analyses show that polishing techniques used to finish and polish nanocomposition surfaces do not affect the surface microhardnesses or microstaining .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is no in vitro evidence to support the choice for nanofill or su bmi cron composites over traditional microhybrids based on better surface smoothness and /or gloss , or based upon maintenance of those superficial characteristics after surface challenges

However , there was a positive association between dairy consumption and body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference ( WMI ) and waist circumference .
There was no difference between total and whole-fat dairy consumption .
Conclusions Our results suggest that dairy consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease .
In addition , there is some evidence for a beneficial effect of low-fat milk consumption on BMI and WMI .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results of the analysis indicated that increased consumption of unsaturated fats , fruits , vegetables and low-fat dietary products  , decreased consumption of dietary sodium and beverages containing caffeine , and breastfeeding were found to have preventive effects against high blood pressure in later years of life .
The effects of training given during youth to encourage a healthy lifestyle and behavior changes based on diet and physical activity were also noted
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference in the incidence of LOS between the two groups .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that lactulose supplementation may reduce the risk of developing C and ida in preterm infants .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of MCT supplementation on LOS .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In RCTs , pasteurized human donor milk , as opposed to formula , reduced NEC but not infections or mortality .
Pooled data of small trials and a recent large RCT suggested that bovine lactoferrin reduced rates of fungal sepsis without impact on other infections , NEC , or mortality .
Pooled data of RCTs assessing the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides found reduced infection but not mortality .
A meta- analysis sensitivity approach found multiple-strain ( but not single-strain ) probiotics to be highly effective in reducing NEC and mortality .

INFO:root:Generated summary: There were no significant differences in the mean change in ADHD symptom scores between the two groups .
There was no significant difference in the rate of medication use .
No significant differences were found in the number of ADHD symptoms reported .
Conclusions : There is limited evidence to support the use of medication for the treatment of ADHD .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results suggest there is moderate-to-high-level evidence that combined pharmacological and behavioral interventions , and pharmacological interventions alone can be effective in managing the core ADHD symptoms and academic performance at 14 months .
However , the effect size may decrease beyond this period .
This review has highlighted the paucity and limitations of the evidence investigating the long-term outcomes of recommended interventions for managing ADHD symptoms .
There is little evidence to suggest that the effects observed over the relatively short term are maintained throughout longer periods of impairment .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review suggest that the use of coloured filters may be beneficial for children with dyslexia .
However , it is not clear whether the effects of these filters on the behaviour of these children are clinical ly relevant .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of these interventions on the performance of dyslexics
INFO:root:Reference summary: While many studies report improvements with coloured lenses , the effect size is generally small and /or similar to the improvement found with a placebo condition .
Consistent with previous review s and advice from several professional bodies , we conclude that the use of coloured lenses or overlays to ameliorate reading difficulties can not be endorsed and that any benefits reported by individuals in clinical setting s are likely to be the result of placebo , practice or Hawthorne effects
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : Preoperative warming is effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative normothermia , but does not reduce the occurrence of SSIs .
Preoperative warming may be associated with a reduction in postoperative infection rates , but the evidence is limited

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that methylpheni date and atomoxetine are similar in terms of their effects on brain activation , but that the effects of both drugs are not consistent .
However , the results of the meta-analyses suggest that the differences between the two drugs may not be clinical ly relevant .
The results suggest that both drugs may have similar effects on the basal ganglia , which is the brain region involved in reward and motivation in ADHD .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the differences in the effect of either of these drugs on other areas of the brain .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS The fMRI analysis showed that methylpheni date significantly enhanced activation in bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC)/insula during inhibition and time discrimination but had no effect on working memory networks .
The meta- analysis , including 14 fMRI data sets and 212 children with ADHD , showed that stimulants most consistently enhanced right IFC/insula activation , which also remained for a subgroup analysis of methylpheni date effects alone .
A more lenient threshold also revealed increased putamen activation .
CONCLUSIONS Psychostimulants most consistently increase right IFC/insula activation , which are key areas of cognitive control and also the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD .
These neurocognitive effects may underlie their positive clinical

INFO:root:Reference summary: Because of the heterogeneity and the limited number of studies , there is no sufficient evidence on the potential role of vasomotor symptoms in metabolic health .
However , both high- quality cohort studies , with large study population s and adjustment for multiple confounding variables showed positive associations between vasomotor symptoms and insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus .
These findings suggest that there is an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic health outcomes .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of anesthesia in THA for the reconstruction of leg length and global and femoral offset .
However , the available evidence suggests that anesthesia is associated with a small improvement in the accuracy and precision of THA reconstruction , as well as with shorter operative time .
Implication s of anesthesia for THA are unclear .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results Significant differences were found in the femoral offset and overall complication rate between the conventional and navigation groups .
Additionally , the conventional group had significantly less anteversion than the navigation group .
However , the navigation group had significantly better inclination .
The operation time was significantly shorter in the conventional than navigation group .
Conclusion Both the OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional total hip arthroplasty result in significant improvements in patient function with similar overall complication rates and have their own advantages in achieving good cup position .
The conventional procedure has a shorter operation time than does use of a navigation system

However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of monetary incentives for TB screening .
There is limited evidence to suggest that they are more effective than non-monetary incentives for tuberculosis screening .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours .
Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .

In addition , the results suggest that there is a significant reduction in the risk of adverse events and a significant decrease in the incidence of serious adverse events .
There is no clear evidence to support the routine use of the extract in the management of the LUT
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of the present meta- analysis suggest that iodine supplementation may improve cognitive and psychomotor performance in iodine-deficient children .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of long-term iodine supplementation on cognitive performance .
There is limited evidence to support the use of iodine supplementation in children and adolescents for the purpose of improving cognitive performance , but there is some evidence to suggest that short-term supplementation may be beneficial for some cognitive outcomes
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , NF may be an effective intervention for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents .
However , the current evidence does not support the use of NF as a first-line treatment for ADHD .
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that MUFA-based diets may be effective in improving glycaemic control , insulin sensitivity , and β cell function in subjects with high fasting triglyceride concentrations .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of MUFAs for improving insulin sensitivity .
The current evidence does not support the replacement of SFAs with other fatty acids or carbohydrates for improving glucose metabolism .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In contrast , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not affected by the amounts of MUFA in the dietary protocol s. Conclusions : In summary , this systematic review found that high MUFA diets appear to be effective in reducing HbA1c , and therefore , should be recommended in the dietary regimes of T2D
INFO:root:Generated summary: Preoperative physical training is effective in reducing the incidence of PPCs in patients at high risk of developing a pulmonary complication after CABG surgery .
Preoperative training may also reduce the duration of hospitalization for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant association between total protein intake and the risk of hip fracture .
Conclusions The current evidence does not support the use of dairy products as a preventive strategy for hip fracture in older adults
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Hydrolyzed protein formula may be effective for improving gastrointestinal motility in preterm infants .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of hydrolysate protein formula for improving GI motility .
There is limited evidence to support its use in the management of GI symptoms in these infants
INFO:root:Reference summary: The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding preterm infants  with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .
The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with protein hydrolysate affects the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .

INFO:root:Generated summary: There is limited evidence to support the use of pedometer-based physical activity interventions for improving walking cadence in adults .
However , there is some evidence to suggest that these interventions may be more effective than other interventions for increasing walking intensity .
There is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific cadence target for adults .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity

However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions The available evidence suggests that oral vitamin C is safe and effective for the prevention and treatment of colds , but that it is not suitable for the treatment of other common colds .
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The RMQ is the most commonly used measure of quality of life in clinical trials , but the evidence for its reliability and validity is limited .
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of the RMQ as the primary measure of health-related quality -of-life for clinical decision-making .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options .
Negative changes were not associated with larger ESs .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Insoles are effective in improving balance and gait in patients with balance impairments .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of glycerine-filled insoles for the management of balance or gait impairments in patients who do not have a history of balance problems
INFO:root:Reference summary: A moderate level of evidence was found in support of using cushioned material s in reducing discomfort/fatigue among st and ing workers .
A limited level of evidence exists in favour of using insoles over anti-fatigue mats .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence for a positive association between social factors and physical health in childhood and adult life .
There is strong evidence that social factors are associated with an increased risk of developing a range of chronic physical and mental health conditions in adulthood .
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Bariatric surgery is associated with significant short-term and long-term improvements in the pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics , especially for amoxicillin and cefazolin .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Patients given oral beta-lactams and macrolides warrant close monitoring due to unpredictable absorption post-bariatric surgery , whereas oral fluoroquinolones and linezolid may not be affected .
Several studies also showed decreased absorption following RYGB , as well as lower serum exposure in patients with obesity compared to non-obese controls .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Estrogen and progestin therapy are associated with an increase in negative mood and physical symptoms in postmenopausal women .
The current evidence does not support the use of either estrogen alone or in combination with progestins for the treatment of depressive symptoms .
INFO:root:Reference summary: This moderate to large effect size , showing lower ratings of depressed mood in treated patients compared with controls , implicated HRT as a potential treatment of or prophylactic for depression in menopausal women .
One can generalize from the studies review ed here only with great caution , but there is little evidence to support the use of estradiol to improve mood in nondepressed patients ( not surprisingly ) and some evidence to support the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal women
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that probiotics may be beneficial for reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract infections in infants and toddlers .
There is limited evidence to support the use of probiotics for the prevention of these conditions .
INFO:root:Reference summary: We found no evidence to support a protective association between perinatal use of probiotics and doctor diagnosed asthma or childhood wheeze .
R and omised controlled trials to date have not yielded sufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the primary prevention of these disorders .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence to support the use of structured exercise interventions for the management of frailty in older adults .
There is limited evidence to suggest that structured exercise programs are effective in improving physical function and improving health status in frail older adults , although the evidence is limited .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion Frequency of 1–6 sessions per week , training volume of 1–3 sets of 6–15 repetitions and intensity of 30–70%1-RM promoted significant enhancements on muscle strength , muscle power , and functional outcomes .
Therefore , in agreement with previous studies , we suggest that supervised and controlled RT represents an effective intervention in frailty treatment
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of death from all causes .
There were no significant differences in the number of patients who died from any cause .
In conclusion , there was no difference in the risk of death between immediate and deferred ADT .
However , there is a significant difference in all-cause mortality between immediate versus delayed ADT , with immediate ADT being associated with a significantly higher risk of all causes of death .
The current evidence does not support the use of immediate or deferred ADTs for PCa detection .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy .
PSA doubling time in < 3 yr or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention .
In men with locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not m and atory , watchful waiting ( WW ) is a treatment alternative to and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) with equivalent oncologic efficacy .
Active treatment is mostly recommended for patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy  with  radical prostatectomy ( RP ) shown to be superior to WW in a prospect i ve r and omised trial .
Nerve-sparing RP represents the approach of choice in organ

Significant improvement in inflammatory markers  support resveratrol as an adjunct to pharmacologic management of metabolic diseases
INFO:root:Generated summary: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for weight loss in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results The results of the meta- analysis show an effect toward the experimental group .
Notably , prevention studies with individual psychoeducational programmes that include diet and /or physical activity seem to have the highest impact .
Conclusions When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and individual lifestyle interventions that include diet and physical activity generally prove to be effective in reducing weight .
This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion Pulp capping with MTA is effective in the treatment of carious-exposed pulp .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that MTA may be an effective and cost-effective option for treating carious pulp exposures in young permanent teeth .
However , the current evidence does not support the use of MTA in the management of pulpal exposures
INFO:root:Reference summary: Vital permanent teeth with cariously exposed pulp can be treated successfully with vital pulp therapy .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that prophylactic radiofrequency ablation is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of VF in patients with structural heart disease .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of the procedure .

Sodium , fructose , and glucose may have similar effects on body weight and BMI .
Conclusions : The consumption of sucrose-sweetened soft drinks , especially those containing high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) , is associated with increased body weight .
The consumption of these products may also have a negative impact on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Subgroup analyses showed the most marked relation between sugar intakes and lipids in studies in which efforts were made to ensure an energy balance and when no difference in weight change was reported .
CONCLUSIONS Dietary sugars  influence blood pressure and serum lipids .
The relation is independent of effects of  sugars on body weight .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that the use of fixed-dose combination drugs for secondary prevention is effective in improving adherence to statins and lowering the risk of nonadherence in stroke survivors .
However , there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of polypareptors on other secondary prevention outcomes such as blood pressure , cholesterol , and triglycerides
INFO:root:Reference summary: Full prescription coverage , reduced copayments , FDC and counselling were facilitators associated with higher adherence .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion : Resveratrol is an effective and safe dietary supplement for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Although the current evidence is limited , it is possible to conclude that the consumption of RES may improve insulin sensitivity in T2DM patients
INFO:root:Reference summary: The drug also reduced homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) index , systolic blood pressure , and diastolic blood pressure among participants with T2DM .
The changes in hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negligible .
Subgroup analysis comparing the resveratrol supplementation doses of < 100 mg/d versus ≥ 100 mg/d revealed a significant difference in fasting plasma glucose .
In particular , the latter dose presented more favorable results .
This meta- analysis provides evidence that supplementation of resveratrol may benefit management of T2DM
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference between the two polishing systems for surface roughness and microhardness .
There were no significant differences between the three polishing techniques for surface micro-hardness and for surface discoloration .
The results of this systematic review suggest that the polishing of nanocomposites is not associated with a significant difference in the micro‐hardness of the surfaces .
However , there is a lack of evidence to support the use of a single polishing technique for the treatment of the surface of composites .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is no in vitro evidence to support the choice for nanofill or su bmi cron composites over traditional microhybrids based on better surface smoothness and /or gloss , or based upon maintenance of those superficial characteristics after surface challenges

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : The current evidence does not support the use of lactulose supplementation in preterm infants for the prevention of C and ida colonization .
However , there is some evidence that lactulosaccharide supplementation may reduce the risk of developing C and Iida .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In RCTs , pasteurized human donor milk , as opposed to formula , reduced NEC but not infections or mortality .
Pooled data of small trials and a recent large RCT suggested that bovine lactoferrin reduced rates of fungal sepsis without impact on other infections , NEC , or mortality .
Pooled data of RCTs assessing the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides found reduced infection but not mortality .
A meta- analysis sensitivity approach found multiple-strain ( but not single-strain ) probiotics to be highly effective in reducing NEC and mortality .
Thus , selected food components may help to improve outcomes in preterm infants

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review suggest that the use of coloured filters may be beneficial for children with dyslexia , particularly for improving reading ability .
However , there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of these filters on other aspects of reading ability , such as spelling and numeracy .
Conclusion This systematic review provides evidence for the beneficial effects of using coloured filters in children with visual impairment and suggests that they may be an effective tool for improving the reading ability of these children
INFO:root:Reference summary: While many studies report improvements with coloured lenses , the effect size is generally small and /or similar to the improvement found with a placebo condition .
Consistent with previous review s and advice from several professional bodies , we conclude that the use of coloured lenses or overlays to ameliorate reading difficulties can not be endorsed and that any benefits reported by individuals in clinical setting s are likely to be the result of placebo , practice or Hawthorne effects
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that preoperative warming may reduce the occurrence of postoperative normothermia , but not the incidence of SSIs .
Preoperative warming is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of SSI , but does not reduce the risk of reoperation , readmissions , or mortality .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The results of this study suggest that preoperative warming can reduce rates of SSI after surgery .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that methylpheni date and atomoxetine are similar in terms of their effects on ADHD symptomatology .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of either drug for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS The fMRI analysis showed that methylpheni date significantly enhanced activation in bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC)/insula during inhibition and time discrimination but had no effect on working memory networks .
The meta- analysis , including 14 fMRI data sets and 212 children with ADHD , showed that stimulants most consistently enhanced right IFC/insula activation , which also remained for a subgroup analysis of methylpheni date effects alone .
A more lenient threshold also revealed increased putamen activation .
CONCLUSIONS Psychostimulants most consistently increase right IFC/insula activation , which are key areas of cognitive control and also the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD .
These neurocognitive effects may underlie their positive clinical

These findings suggest that there is an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic health outcomes .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , the current evidence supports the use of imageless navigation in THA .
However , there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of this technique in terms of patient safety and quality of life .
The current evidence does not support its use in primary total hip arthroplasty
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results Significant differences were found in the femoral offset and overall complication rate between the conventional and navigation groups .
Additionally , the conventional group had significantly less anteversion than the navigation group .
However , the navigation group had significantly better inclination .
The operation time was significantly shorter in the conventional than navigation group .
Conclusion Both the OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional total hip arthroplasty result in significant improvements in patient function with similar overall complication rates and have their own advantages in achieving good cup position .
The conventional procedure has a shorter operation time than does use of a navigation system
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that financial incentives may be effective in increasing the return rate for TB skin test reading .
However , it is unclear whether financial incentives alone or in combination with other interventions are more effective than other interventions in increasing TB screening results .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours .
Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion Probiotic supplementation significantly reduced weight gain in pregnant women with GDM .
In conclusion , probiotic supplementation may be an effective intervention to reduce weight gain and improve glycemia and insulin sensitivity in GDM patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Among secondary endpoints , a significant reduction of maternal insulin ( both in women with or without diabetes ) was observed in the probiotics group .

However , the effects of these agents were not associated with changes in HDL-C or LDL-C levels .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that fibrate and Omega-3-containing fatty acids are associated with significant reductions in serum levels/activities of inflammatory markers in patients with high triglyceride levels , but not with other biomarkers of inflammation .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : This meta‐ analysis has shown that fibrate treatment  significantly decreases fasting plasma glucose , insulin levels , and HOMA‐IR indicating additional clinical therapeutic benefits .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence for the reliability and validity of the Cronbach Scale and its validity as a psychometric tool for measuring weight-stigmatising attitudes and behaviors in individuals with obesity .
The Cronbach scale is a valid psychometric instrument that can be used to measure weight stigmatising attitudes , behaviours and beliefs in people with obesity , as well as to measure the impact of these attitudes on health outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Most question naires were brief , demonstrated adequate internal consistency , and tapped key cognitive and affective dimensions of weight bias such as stereotypes and blaming .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence that nonoperative treatment of acute appendicitis with antibiotics is safe and effective in reducing the risk of recurrence of the condition .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of antibiotics for the management of acute nonperforated appendix .
INFO:root:Reference summary: With significantly higher efficacy and low complication rates , appendectomy remains the most effective treatment for patients with uncomplicated AA .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that the use of Serenoa repens extracts for the treatment of LUTS is associated with a significant improvement in Qmax , Qmed , and PVR , but not with erectile function .
Conclusion This systematic review provides evidence that the administration of the extract is effective in improving Qmax and Qmed in patients with BPH .
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that iodine supplementation is associated with improvements in cognitive and psychomotor performance in iodine-deficient children and adolescents .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of long-term iodine supplementation on cognitive performance .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that NF is effective in reducing hyperactivity and impulsivity in children and adolescents with ADHD .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of NF as an adjunct to stimulants in ADHD treatment
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis showed that olanzapine is superior to haloperidol and risperidone in terms of efficacy , safety and tolerability in the treatment of bipolar disorder .
However , there was no significant difference in the rate of adverse events .
The current meta‐ analysis did not reveal any significant differences in the efficacy or safety of other antipsychotics .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for  acute mania .
From the limited data available , there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone .
Some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole .
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference in the rate of recurrence of AF after AF ablation .
In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of PVI for the prevention of AF recurrence .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Dilated LA significantly increases the risk of AF recurrence after  single CPVI .
This is especially applicable to the patients with long-term follow-up
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that cefazolin prophylaxis is effective in the prevention of surgical site infections in adults undergoing cardiac surgery .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support its use in the management of postoperative wound infections .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There were no statistically significant differences in mortality , infections overall and adverse events .
Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis of ≥24 hours may be more efficacious in preventing sternal SSIs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to shorter regimens .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Metformin therapy is associated with an increase in homocysteine , folate and vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes .
The current evidence suggests that metformin treatment may be associated with a small increase in serum total Hcy ( tHcy ) and a decrease in folate ( tFc ) levels .
Metformin may also have a small effect on vitamin B-12 levels .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Therefore , although the overall effect of metformin on the concentration of serum Hcy was neutral , our results suggested that metformin could increase the concentration of Hcy when exogenous B-group vitamins or folic acid supplementation was not given
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Our results suggest that MUFA-containing diets may be effective in improving glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity in people with high fasting glucose , insulin , and HbA1c levels .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the effects of MUFA supplementation on other glycemic parameters .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In contrast , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not affected by the amounts of MUFA in the dietary protocol s. Conclusions : In summary , this systematic review found that high MUFA diets appear to be effective in reducing HbA1c , and therefore , should be recommended in the dietary regimes of T2D
INFO:root:Generated summary: Preoperative physical training significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and length of hospitalization after CABG surgery .
However , there was no significant effect on postoperative quality of life .
CONCLUSION Preoperative physical therapy is effective in reducing the incidence and duration of PPCs and improving pulmonary function post-CABG .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Milk consumption is associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in older adults compared with other dairy products .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of dairy consumption on hip fracture risk .
The current evidence suggests that dairy consumption may have a role in reducing the risk of fracture .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that hydrolyzed protein formula may be effective in improving gastrointestinal motility in preterm infants with feeding intolerance .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of hydrolysate protein formula for improving motility and GI symptoms of GER .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding preterm infants  with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .
The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with protein hydrolysate affects the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the effectiveness of community-based interventions in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure in children and young adults in low-income countries .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions There is a dearth of evidence on the implementation of task-shifting strategies to reduce the burden of CVD in LMICs .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence for the effectiveness of PBL in improving health-related quality of life ( QoL ) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( CVD ) after discharge from hospital
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was evidence to suggest that education can improve HRQoL and decrease healthcare costs by reductions in downstream healthcare utilization .
Conclusions : Our review had insufficient power to exclude clinical ly important effects of education on mortality and morbidity .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the role of height and stride length in determining walking cadence in adults .
Pedometer-based physical activity interventions can be effective in increasing walking intensity and reducing sedentary time .
However , there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of height or stride length on the effectiveness of these interventions .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , adiponectin and leptin were associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer , but not with the risk of dying from the disease .
The relationship between leptin and prostate cancer was not affected by age , sex , BMI , sex hormone status , prostate size , or prostate cancer type .
CONCLUSION The current meta- analysis suggests that leptin is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer in men with high risk factors for prostate cancer .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The current evidence does not suggest an association between leptin and PCa outcome .
However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , the current evidence does not support the use of large doses of vitamin C for the prevention and treatment of colds .
However , there is some evidence to suggest that vitamin C may be effective in the prevention of the common cold .
Vitamin C is safe and effective in preventing and treating colds , and its use in the prophylactic use of small amounts may be worthwhile .
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The RMQ has been shown to be sensitive to clinical ly relevant changes in quality of life and to be responsive to changes in patient characteristics .
However , it is unclear whether the RMQ can be used as a surrogate measure of clinical ly important change in patients with chronic conditions .
Conclusion The RMQ is a valid and valid instrument for measuring chronic conditions , but it is not suitable as an independent measure of change in quality -of-life .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options .
Negative changes were not associated with larger ESs .
Population -based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with smaller ESs , and acute conditions with larger ESs .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that cannabis use is associated with an increase in psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia and related disorders .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about whether cannabis use has a negative impact on clinical outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: INTERPRETATION Continued cannabis use after onset of psychosis predicts adverse outcome , including higher relapse rates , longer hospital admissions , and more severe positive symptoms than for individuals who discontinue cannabis use and those who are non-users .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , iron administration is safe and effective as an adjunct to erythropoietin and erythrocyte reticulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( ERF ) therapy in dialysis patients and is associated with a lower risk of bacteremia .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of iron administration as an adjuvant to ERF therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease .
INFO:root:Reference summary: High-dose parenteral iron does not seem to be associated with higher risk of infection , all-cause mortality , increased hospitalization or increased cardiovascular events on analysis of RCTs .
Observational studies show increased risk for all-cause mortality , infections and hospitalizations that were not statistically significant and were associated with significant heterogeneity
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis showed that weight loss is associated with significant reductions in CRP and SSPG , but not with other biomarkers of adiposity .
There was no significant effect of weight loss on HDL-C , HbA1c , HOMA-IR , or CRP .
However , weight loss was associated with a significant reduction in total cholesterol , triglycerides , and LDL-C levels .
Conclusions Our results suggest that weight-loss interventions are associated with beneficial effects on adiposity , insulin resistance , and CRP in overweight and obese subjects
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS Weight loss was associated with a decline in CRP level .
Our results suggest that weight loss may be an effective nonpharmacologic strategy for lowering CRP level
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that cemented total hip arthroplasty is associated with better long-term outcomes compared with uncemented total hip and femoral component design .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of cementless total hip or cemented acetabular fixation for all types of total hip surgery
INFO:root:Reference summary: INTERPRETATION There was a clinical ly relevant association between early migration of acetabular cups  and late revision due to loosening .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that preterm infants and children are at least as likely to show language delays as full term peers .
Early language development in preterm children is affected by a wide range of factors , including prematurity , age , sex , gender , gestational age , and gestational duration , as well as by neuropsychological abnormalities .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS : Preterm-born children scored significantly lower compared with term-born children on simple ( d = –0.45 [ 95 % CI : –0.59 to –0.30 ] ; P < .001 ) and on complex ( d = –0.62 [ 95 % CI : –0.82 to –0.43 ] ; P < .001 ) language function tests , even in the absence of major disabilities and independent of social economic status .
: While growing up , preterm-born children have increasing difficulties with complex language function
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that vitamin D supplementation is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality in children and adolescents with asthma .
Vitamin D supplementation does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of developing asthma .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The available very low to low quality evidence does not confirm or rule out beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The DASH diet significantly reduced total cholesterol , LDL-C , TG , and HDL-C levels .
In conclusion , the DASH dietary pattern may be effective in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes , as well as other cardiometabolic risk factors in diabetic patients
INFO:root:Reference summary: The DASH dietary pattern may lead to an improvement in insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss .
The DASH diet may play an important role in glycemic control in long- term interventions .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors are effective in reducing glycaemic variability and improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Initial combination therapy with DPP-IV inhibitors more effectively reduced MAGE than stepwise add-on therapies ( p = 0.006 ) , although no differences in MAGE were found based on HbA1c values .
These findings indicate that DPP-IV inhibitors are promising alternatives for reducing GV in type 2 diabetes patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that low-intensity motor exercise training is effective in improving physical capacity in individuals with spinal cord injury .
This review also provides evidence for the use of motor exercise as a component of physiotherapy in the rehabilitation of individuals with SCI .

However , there is remarkably little research , particularly for individuals who do not have spinal-cord injury
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence for the existence of a relationship between childhood trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) in individuals with SCI .
There is limited evidence that childhood trauma is associated with an increased risk of developing PTSD in later life .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : Combinations of peri- and post-injury factors appear to be influential in the development of PTSD among persons with SCI .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , the current evidence suggests that aRT is associated with a significant improvement in BCR-free survival in patients with pT3pN0 , R0-R1 , and R1 PCa .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of aRT on other outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with mCRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications .
PATIENT SUMMARY In men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only , it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since survival and quality of life may never be affected in many of these patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence for the use of magnification lenses in dental education to improve working posture .
The results of this review indicate that magnification lenses may improve the working posture of dental students .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support their use in clinical practice
INFO:root:Reference summary: CONCLUSIONS Based on a limited number of studies , the use of ergonomic saddle seats and dental loupes leads to improved working postures .
The use of loupes appears to relieve shoulder , arm and h and pain .
However , their effect on neck pain is scarce .
None of the studies reported on the effect of the saddle seats on musculoskeletal pain .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that MTA is a safe and effective alternative to formocresol in pulpotomy in primary molars with carious pulp exposure .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that glycerine-filled insoles may be effective in improving balance and gait performance in patients with moderate to severe balance impairments .
However , the current evidence does not support the use of these insoles for all-cause mortality .
INFO:root:Reference summary: A moderate level of evidence was found in support of using cushioned material s in reducing discomfort/fatigue among st and ing workers .
A limited level of evidence exists in favour of using insoles over anti-fatigue mats .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence for a positive association between childhood adversities and physical health outcomes in later life .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between these associations and long-term outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Bariatric surgery is associated with significant short-term and long-term effects on the pharmacokinetics of oral antibiotics .
Bariatric surgery may have a beneficial effect on the absorption of amoxicillin , but the effects on other antimicrobials are unknown
INFO:root:Reference summary: Patients given oral beta-lactams and macrolides warrant close monitoring due to unpredictable absorption post-bariatric surgery , whereas oral fluoroquinolones and linezolid may not be affected .
Several studies also showed decreased absorption following RYGB , as well as lower serum exposure in patients with obesity compared to non-obese controls .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that estrogen therapy is associated with an increase in negative mood and physical symptoms in older women with premenstrual syndrome .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of estrogen alone or in combination with progestin for the treatment of postmenopausal depression .
INFO:root:Reference summary: This moderate to large effect size , showing lower ratings of depressed mood in treated patients compared with controls , implicated HRT as a potential treatment of or prophylactic for depression in menopausal women .
One can generalize from the studies review ed here only with great caution , but there is little evidence to support the use of estradiol to improve mood in nondepressed patients ( not surprisingly ) and some evidence to support the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal women
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that probiotics and prebiotics are effective in reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract infections in infants and toddlers .
The results suggest that probiotic use may be associated with a significant reduction in the occurrence of these infections .
INFO:root:Reference summary: We found no evidence to support a protective association between perinatal use of probiotics and doctor diagnosed asthma or childhood wheeze .
R and omised controlled trials to date have not yielded sufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the primary prevention of these disorders .
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference in radiolucency , kinematics , or KSS , between the two groups .
Conclusion This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence that mobile bearing knee arthroplasty is superior to fixed bearing UKA in terms of kinematic performance .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of mobile bearing for medial UKA .
INFO:root:Reference summary: After stratification on follow-up time and age , the revision rates were not substantially different , aside for younger patients in short term from studies with short-term follow-up .
Conclusion No essential differences between the two design s were observed .
MB and FB UKA design s have comparable revision rates .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the effectiveness of structured exercise training in improving physical function and health status in older adults with frailty .
There is limited evidence to support the use of exercise training for the management of frailty in this population
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion Frequency of 1–6 sessions per week , training volume of 1–3 sets of 6–15 repetitions and intensity of 30–70%1-RM promoted significant enhancements on muscle strength , muscle power , and functional outcomes .
Therefore , in agreement with previous studies , we suggest that supervised and controlled RT represents an effective intervention in frailty treatment
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of death from all causes .
There was also no difference in the rate of all-cause mortality .
In conclusion , there is no evidence that immediate ADT is superior to delayed ADT for the detection of PCa .
Early ADT may be an effective strategy for the early detection of prostate cancer and may be associated with an increased survival rate
INFO:root:Reference summary: Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy .
PSA doubling time in < 3 yr or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention .
In men with locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not m and atory , watchful waiting ( WW ) is a treatment alternative to and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) with equivalent oncologic efficacy .
Active treatment is mostly recommended for patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy  with  radical prostatectomy ( RP ) shown to be superior to WW in a prospect i ve r and omised trial .
Nerve-sparing RP represents the approach of choice in organ
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion This meta- analysis suggests that resveratrol supplementation with calcium fructoborate is associated with a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in patients with chronic obstructive sleep apnea .
It is also associated with an increase in HDL-C and LDL-C , and with a decrease in triglyceride levels .
INFO:root:Reference summary: IMPLICATION S Available evidence from RCTs suggests that resveratrol supplementation significantly reduced TNF-α and hs-CRP levels .
Significant improvement in inflammatory markers  support resveratrol as an adjunct to pharmacologic management of metabolic diseases
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) in reducing weight gain in people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder .
The results suggest that CBT may be an effective and safe intervention for weight loss in patients with schizophrenia .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results The results of the meta- analysis show an effect toward the experimental group .
Notably , prevention studies with individual psychoeducational programmes that include diet and /or physical activity seem to have the highest impact .
Conclusions When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and individual lifestyle interventions that include diet and physical activity generally prove to be effective in reducing weight .
This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion This systematic review provides evidence for the use of MTA as a pulp capping agent in the treatment of carious-exposed pulp in children and adolescents .

In conclusion , there is no evidence to support the use of any adhesive for the bonding of orthodontic brackets in vitro .
Adhesives that are precoated with a pre-coated adhesive are superior to those that are uncoated in terms of shear bond strength , but there is not enough evidence to recommend their use in the clinical setting
INFO:root:Reference summary: Many studies on in-vitro orthodontic bond strength fail to report test conditions that could significantly affect their outcomes
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence to support the use of diuretics for the management of high blood pressure in older adults .
There is moderate evidence that diuretic therapy is effective in reducing the risk of stroke , myocardial infa rct ion , and all-cause mortality .
However , the available evidence does not support its use in the prevention of cardiovascular death .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Strict control [ systolic BP ( SBP ) < 140 mmHg ] was not consistently better than mild control ( SBP < 150 mmHg ) for adults aged ≥65 years .
Mild SBP control benefitted subjects in all age ranges over 65 years .
Conclusions In this review , older adults with hypertension had decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  with antihypertensives compared with no treatment .
Strict control was not consistently better than mild control in older adults .
The current evidence is insufficient to determine the safest , most beneficial hypertension regimen in older adults
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in migraine prophylaxis .
Antidepressants are effective in reducing the frequency and severity of migraine attacks .
However , they are associated with a number of adverse effects , including nausea , vomiting , dizziness , drowsiness , and constipation .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Over 2 months of treatment , SSRIs are no more efficacious than placebo in patients with migraine .
In patients with chronic TTH , SSRIs are less efficacious than tricyclic antidepressants .
In comparison with SSRIs , the burden of adverse events in patients receiving tricyclics was greater .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that SSSDs may be associated with an increased risk of CVD in overweight/obese adults .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the reliability and validity of a number of st and ard tests for the diagnosis of rotator cuff and shoulder disease , as well as for their use in the treatment of general shoulder disease .
INFO:root:Reference summary: No tests for impingement or acromioclavicular ( AC ) joint pathology demonstrated significant diagnostic accuracy .
Based on pooled data , the diagnostic accuracy of the Neer test for impingement , the Hawkins-Kennedy test for impingement and the Speed test for labral pathology is limited .
Currently , almost without exception , there is a lack of clarity with regard to whether common OSTs used in clinical examination are useful in differentially diagnosing pathologies of the shoulder
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , MTA was found to be superior to IRM in terms of retention of root-end filling material s and marginal sealing of the retrocavity after retropreparation .
However , there was no significant difference in the success rate of MTA and IRM .
Conclusion MTA is superior in retention of the root endodontic sealer in the short term , but the long-term success rate was not significantly different .
There is no evidence to support the use of MTA in the long term .
The current evidence suggests that MTA may be an effective and safe option for the retention of retrofilling material s in root-ends
INFO:root:Reference summary: On the basis of available evidence , MTA presented good marginal adaptation to dentine walls .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that health fairs and incentives may be effective in increasing smoking cessation and smoking cessation rates in worksite smoking cessation programs .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of incentives for smoking cessation in general .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Personal financial incentives can change habitual health-related behaviors and help reduce health inequalities .
However , their role in reducing disease burden is potentially limited given current evidence that effects dissipate beyond three months post-incentive removal
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis identified a number of risk factors for musculoskeletal injuries in light infantry recruits .
The majority of these risk factors were associated with low physical fitness .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about which risk factors are more likely to be associated with injuries .
There is limited evidence to support the use of exercise as a preventative measure of injury .
In light of the limited evidence available , it is difficult to draw conclusions about the role of exercise in reducing the incidence of injuries in the light infantry .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Primary findings indicate that there is ( a ) strong evidence that poor performance on a set distance run for time is a predictor for MSK-I risk in both genders ; ( b ) strong evidence that poor performance on timed shuttle runs is a predictor for MSK-I risk in males ; ( c ) moderate evidence in males and limited evidence in females that poor performance on a timed step test is a predictor of MSK-I risk ; and ( d ) limited or insufficient evidence that poor performance on the Cooper run test , maximal and submaximal aerobic grade d exercise tests , and the Conconi test are predictors of MSK-I risk in males or females or both .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion : Resveratrol supplementation significantly improves glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in T2DM patients .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that the consumption of RES is associated with a significant improvement in glucose homeostasis , insulin resistance and glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
INFO:root:Reference summary: The drug also reduced homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) index , systolic blood pressure , and diastolic blood pressure among participants with T2DM .
The changes in hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negligible .
Subgroup analysis comparing the resveratrol supplementation doses of < 100 mg/d versus ≥ 100 mg/d revealed a significant difference in fasting plasma glucose .
In particular , the latter dose presented more favorable results .
This meta- analysis provides evidence that supplementation of resveratrol may benefit management of T2DM
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , the results of this systematic review indicate that surface roughness and microhardness of nanocomposites are not affected by polishing techniques .
However , there is a lack of evidence to support the use of a single polishing technique for the treatment of all surfaces .

INFO:root:Reference summary: There is no in vitro evidence to support the choice for nanofill or su bmi cron composites over traditional microhybrids based on better surface smoothness and /or gloss , or based upon maintenance of those superficial characteristics after surface challenges
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence for the effectiveness of exercise interventions in improving physical function and reducing falls in community-dwelling older adults with a history of falls .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The multi-component exercise intervention composed by strength , endurance and balance training seems to be the best strategy to improve rate of falls , gait ability , balance , and strength performance in physically frail older adults
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness are positively associated with academic performance in children and adolescents .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the association between physical activity in childhood and subsequent academic performance
INFO:root:Reference summary: Overall , we found data that support a negative relationship between obesity and various aspects of neurocognitive functioning , such as executive functioning , attention , visuo-spatial performance , and motor skill .
The existing literature is mixed on the effects among obesity , general cognitive functioning , language , learning , memory , and academic achievement .
Executive dysfunction is associated with obesity-related behaviors , such as increased intake , disinhibited eating , and less physical activity .
Physical activity is positively linked with motor skill .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : The Mediterranean diet is associated with significant reductions in blood pressure , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and total cholesterol , as well as with a reduction in total and LDL-cholesterol , and with a significant reduction in triglycerides .
The Mediterranean diet appears to be effective in lowering blood pressure and lowering total cholesterol .
In conclusion , the Mediterranean diet may be an effective strategy for the prevention of CVD

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that workplace disability management practice s can be effective in reducing the duration of disability leave and improving the resumption rate of workers with disability .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of a single measure of disability management effectiveness .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The DM program has shown to be effective and efficient .
Nevertheless , some components are emphasized more than others ; job accommodation , facilitation of transitional duty , communication between all stakeholders , health care provider advice , early intervention , and acceptance , goodwill and trust in the stakeholders , in the organization , and in the disability management process
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that school-based health promotion interventions can be effective in increasing physical activity and lowering blood pressure in adolescents and young adults .
However , it is unclear whether they are effective in reducing other risk factors for cardiovascular disease , such as smoking , smoking , and alcohol consumption .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results of the analysis indicated that increased consumption of unsaturated fats , fruits , vegetables and low-fat dietary products  , decreased consumption of dietary sodium and beverages containing caffeine , and breastfeeding were found to have preventive effects against high blood pressure in later years of life .
The effects of training given during youth to encourage a healthy lifestyle and behavior changes based on diet and physical activity were also noted
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion This systematic review provides evidence that lactulose supplementation is safe and effective in reducing the risk of C and ida colonization in preterm infants .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the safety and efficacy of other prebiotics .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In RCTs , pasteurized human donor milk , as opposed to formula , reduced NEC but not infections or mortality .
Pooled data of small trials and a recent large RCT suggested that bovine lactoferrin reduced rates of fungal sepsis without impact on other infections , NEC , or mortality .
Pooled data of RCTs assessing the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides found reduced infection but not mortality .
A meta- analysis sensitivity approach found multiple-strain ( but not single-strain ) probiotics to be highly effective in reducing NEC and mortality .
Thus , selected food components may help to improve outcomes in preterm infants
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for the effectiveness of task shifting interventions in improving health outcomes after MI .
Task shifting interventions may be a promising strategy to improve health outcomes in people who have suffered from MI , especially in the short term

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : Iron supplementation is effective in improving motor and cognitive development in children with low haemoglobin levels .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between iron supplementation and language development .
The effect of iron supplementation on motor development is not consistent across studies .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Iron supplementation improves mental development score modestly .
This effect is particularly apparent for intelligence tests above 7 years of age and in initially anaemic or iron-deficient anaemic subjects .
There is no convincing evidence that iron treatment has an effect on mental development in children below 27 months of age or on motor development
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of long-term outcomes .
In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of medication for the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results suggest there is moderate-to-high-level evidence that combined pharmacological and behavioral interventions , and pharmacological interventions alone can be effective in managing the core ADHD symptoms and academic performance at 14 months .
However , the effect size may decrease beyond this period .
This review has highlighted the paucity and limitations of the evidence investigating the long-term outcomes of recommended interventions for managing ADHD symptoms .
There is little evidence to suggest that the effects observed over the relatively short term are maintained throughout longer periods of impairment .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of any of the interventions for Dupuytren ’s disease .
There is some evidence that collagenase is superior to fasciectomy in the short term and that corticosteroid injections are superior in the long term , but the evidence is inconclusive for the long-term effectiveness of collagenase .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Outcomes , such as range of motion , recurrence , and clinical success , were frequently defined , however many different definitions were used .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence that financial incentives can be effective in promoting behavioral change in people who are overweight or obese .
However , it is unclear whether financial incentives alone or in combination with other interventions can lead to long-term change in weight loss or smoking cessation behaviors .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Our framework should help research ers and policy-makers identify the most effective incentive configurations for helping individuals adopt healthy behaviours
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that the use of a 3-cyc/deg square-wave grating with a light-emitting diodes ( 3-D ) filter is effective in improving reading ability in children with dyslexia .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of a 4-D filter on reading ability .
Conclusion : The use of 3D square wave grating is effective for improving the reading ability of dyslexic children with visual impairment .
INFO:root:Reference summary: While many studies report improvements with coloured lenses , the effect size is generally small and /or similar to the improvement found with a placebo condition .
Consistent with previous review s and advice from several professional bodies , we conclude that the use of coloured lenses or overlays to ameliorate reading difficulties can not be endorsed and that any benefits reported by individuals in clinical setting s are likely to be the result of placebo , practice or Hawthorne effects
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of preoperative warming for the prevention of perioperative normothermia after colorectal or pancreasal surgery .
Preoperative warming is associated with a lower risk of postoperative infection and a shorter duration of hospitalization .
However , there is limited evidence that active warming is effective in reducing the incidence of SSIs .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The results of this study suggest that preoperative warming can reduce rates of SSI after surgery .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that methylpheni date is superior to other stimulants in terms of brain activation in ADHD patients .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of ATX on other aspects of brain function in ADHD .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS The fMRI analysis showed that methylpheni date significantly enhanced activation in bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC)/insula during inhibition and time discrimination but had no effect on working memory networks .
The meta- analysis , including 14 fMRI data sets and 212 children with ADHD , showed that stimulants most consistently enhanced right IFC/insula activation , which also remained for a subgroup analysis of methylpheni date effects alone .
A more lenient threshold also revealed increased putamen activation .
CONCLUSIONS Psychostimulants most consistently increase right IFC/insula activation , which are key areas of cognitive control and also the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD .
These neurocognitive effects may underlie their positive clinical
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that pycnogenol supplementation is effective in reducing oxidative stress and improving lipid profile in humans .
In conclusion , the results suggest that pine bark extract supplementation may be an effective intervention to reduce the levels of oxidative stress in humans
INFO:root:Reference summary: Present systematic review and meta- analysis suggested Pycnogenol consumption can decrease the level of CRP and have anti-inflammatory effect .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence that testosterone and oestradiol levels are associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in postmenopausal women .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Because of the heterogeneity and the limited number of studies , there is no sufficient evidence on the potential role of vasomotor symptoms in metabolic health .
However , both high- quality cohort studies , with large study population s and adjustment for multiple confounding variables showed positive associations between vasomotor symptoms and insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus .
These findings suggest that there is an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic health outcomes .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of a single navigation technique for THA .
However , the available evidence suggests that a combination of orthopaedic navigation with fluoroscopy and anesthesia may be a feasible option for the minimally invasive THA , and that the combination of the two techniques may be the best option for primary total hip arthroplasty .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results Significant differences were found in the femoral offset and overall complication rate between the conventional and navigation groups .
Additionally , the conventional group had significantly less anteversion than the navigation group .
However , the navigation group had significantly better inclination .
The operation time was significantly shorter in the conventional than navigation group .
Conclusion Both the OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional total hip arthroplasty result in significant improvements in patient function with similar overall complication rates and have their own advantages in achieving good cup position .
The conventional procedure has a shorter operation time than does use of a navigation system
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that financial incentives are effective in increasing the return rate for tuberculosis skin test reading .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of financial incentives on the effectiveness of interventions on TB prevention .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours .
Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Probiotic supplementation may be an effective intervention to improve glycemic control in pregnant women with GDM .
The results of this systematic review suggest that probiotic supplementation is effective in improving glucose metabolism and reducing weight gain in GDM patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Among secondary endpoints , a significant reduction of maternal insulin ( both in women with or without diabetes ) was observed in the probiotics group .
INTERPRETATION Probiotics during pregnancy do not reduce the incidence of GDM , with a very little ( statistically but not clinical ly significant ) reduction of fasting plasma glucose
INFO:root:Generated summary: The effects of fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids on serum IGF-I and PAI-1 were not associated with changes in plasma glucose levels .
In conclusion , the results of this meta- analysis suggest that fibrate therapy may be associated with a reduction in serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-I , but not with other markers of insulin resistance such as glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : This meta‐ analysis has shown that fibrate treatment  significantly decreases fasting plasma glucose , insulin levels , and HOMA‐IR indicating additional clinical therapeutic benefits .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This review provides evidence for the reliability and validity of the Cronbach Scale for the assessment of psychological factors associated with overweight and obesity , as well as for its psychometric properties .
Conclusions The Cronbach scale is a valid psychometric instrument that can be used to assess psychological factors that are associated with weight-related beliefs and behaviours .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Most question naires were brief , demonstrated adequate internal consistency , and tapped key cognitive and affective dimensions of weight bias such as stereotypes and blaming .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of surgical treatment for the management of acute appendicitis in children .
However , there is some evidence to suggest that non-operative treatment may be an effective option in the short-term management of the condition .
INFO:root:Reference summary: With significantly higher efficacy and low complication rates , appendectomy remains the most effective treatment for patients with uncomplicated AA .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that the use of Serenoa repens extracts for the treatment of LUTS is associated with a significant improvement in Qmax , Qmed and PVR , but not with an improvement in erectile function .
In conclusion , the results of the present meta‐ analysis indicate that the administration of the extract for the management of low back pain in patients with chronic benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BCM ) results in a statistically significant improvement of Qmax and Qmed .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the effects of the use or non-use of the extracts on erectile functions .
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that iodine supplementation is associated with an improvement in cognitive and psychomotor performance in iodine-deficient children .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of long-term iodine supplementation on cognitive performance .
There is limited evidence to support the use of iodine supplementation in children and adolescents in the prevention of MTF
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that NF may be an effective treatment for ADHD symptomatology in children and adolescents .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of NF for the treatment of ADHD symptoms .
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Olanzapine is superior to haloperidol in terms of efficacy , tolerability , and safety in the treatment of bipolar disorder .
The efficacy and safety profile of olanazapine are comparable to that of haloperodol and risperidone in the management of bipolar mania .
However , the safety profile is not comparable to either of the two drugs .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for  acute mania .
From the limited data available , there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone .
Some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed no significant differences in the rate of recurrence of AF recurrence after AF ablation .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the role of LV systolic dysfunction or pulmonary vein isolation in the prevention and treatment of AF
INFO:root:Reference summary: Dilated LA significantly increases the risk of AF recurrence after  single CPVI .
This is especially applicable to the patients with long-term follow-up
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : The use of cefazolin prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical site infections after cardiac surgery is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative wound infections compared with the use of ticarcillin/clavulanate or vancomycin .
However , there was no significant difference in the incidence of wound infections between the two groups .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There were no statistically significant differences in mortality , infections overall and adverse events .
Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis of ≥24 hours may be more efficacious in preventing sternal SSIs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared to shorter regimens .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Compared with placebo , metformin is associated with an increase in homocysteine and a decrease in folate levels in patients with type 2 diabetes .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of the use of metformins on the levels of folate , vitamin B12 and homocystine .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Therefore , although the overall effect of metformin on the concentration of serum Hcy was neutral , our results suggested that metformin could increase the concentration of Hcy when exogenous B-group vitamins or folic acid supplementation was not given
INFO:root:Generated summary: The meta- analysis showed that MUFA-containing diets were associated with significant reductions in serum TG , HbA1c , TC , and LDL-cholesterol .
However , there was no significant effect on insulin .
Conclusions : Compared with SFAs , MUFAs were not associated with a significant reduction in total cholesterol , HDL-c , LDL-c and triglycerides .
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of MUFA as a replacement for SFAs in improving glycaemic control
INFO:root:Reference summary: In contrast , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not affected by the amounts of MUFA in the dietary protocol s. Conclusions : In summary , this systematic review found that high MUFA diets appear to be effective in reducing HbA1c , and therefore , should be recommended in the dietary regimes of T2D
INFO:root:Generated summary: Preoperative physical training is effective in reducing the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications after CABG surgery .
Preoperative exercise training is associated with a significant reduction in the occurrence of PPCs and postoperative length of hospital stay .
However , there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of physical training on the incidence and severity of pulmonary complications post-CABG .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Milk consumption is associated with a lower risk of hip fracture compared with other dairy products .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of dairy products on the risk of fracture in the general population
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Hydrolyzed protein formula is effective in improving gastrointestinal motility in preterm infants with symptoms of GER .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of hydrolysate protein formula for improving gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms in these infants compared with st and ard formula .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding preterm infants  with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .
The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with protein hydrolysate affects the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence for the effectiveness of community-based interventions for the management of high blood pressure in children and young adults in developing countries .

INFO:root:Reference summary: There was evidence to suggest that education can improve HRQoL and decrease healthcare costs by reductions in downstream healthcare utilization .
Conclusions : Our review had insufficient power to exclude clinical ly important effects of education on mortality and morbidity .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis support the use of pedometer-based physical activity interventions to improve walking cadence and improve blood pressure in people with a history of cardiometabolic disorders .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support a recommendation for a specific cadence target for adults
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that adiponectin and leptin may be associated with an increased risk of developing high-grade prostate cancer .
However , the association between these hormones and the incidence of the disease was not statistically significant .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between leptin and prostate cancer
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The current evidence does not suggest an association between leptin and PCa outcome .
However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Our results suggest that vitamin C is safe and effective in the prevention and treatment of colds and flu .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of large doses of vitamin C in the management of the common cold .
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions The RMQ has been shown to be a valid and valid instrument for measuring changes in quality of life in patients with chronic pain .
The RMQ can be used as a surrogate measure of clinical ly relevant change in the short term and as a measure of long-term change in chronic pain patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options .
Negative changes were not associated with larger ESs .
Population -based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with smaller ESs , and acute conditions with larger ESs .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Cannabis use is associated with a small but statistically significant increase in symptoms of psychosis and depression in people with schizophrenia and related disorders .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about whether cannabis use has a negative impact on clinical outcomes .
Conclusions The current evidence does not support a causal relationship between cannabis use and clinical outcomes in schizophrenia .
INFO:root:Reference summary: INTERPRETATION Continued cannabis use after onset of psychosis predicts adverse outcome , including higher relapse rates , longer hospital admissions , and more severe positive symptoms than for individuals who discontinue cannabis use and those who are non-users .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , iron administration is safe and effective as an adjunct to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents ( ESA ) in anemia-impairing erythrocyte deficiency and is associated with a lower risk of bacteremia in patients with PD
INFO:root:Reference summary: High-dose parenteral iron does not seem to be associated with higher risk of infection , all-cause mortality , increased hospitalization or increased cardiovascular events on analysis of RCTs .
Observational studies show increased risk for all-cause mortality , infections and hospitalizations that were not statistically significant and were associated with significant heterogeneity
INFO:root:Generated summary: The effects of weight loss on blood lipids and CRP were not statistically significant .
In conclusion , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific diet for the reduction of CRP or other inflammatory markers .
However , weight loss appears to be associated with a significant reduction in inflammatory markers such as CRP and TNF-α .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS Weight loss was associated with a decline in CRP level .
Our results suggest that weight loss may be an effective nonpharmacologic strategy for lowering CRP level
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cemented total hip arthroplasty with hydroxyapatite bearing for the long-term outcomes of patients who have undergone uncemented or cemented TTH .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The DASH diet significantly reduced total cholesterol , LDL-C , triglycerides , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels .
It also reduced total and LDL-cholesterol by a greater amount than the control diet .
Conclusions This meta- analysis suggests that the DASH dietary pattern may have a beneficial effect on the reduction of total cholesterol and triglycerides in people with type 2 diabetes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The DASH dietary pattern may lead to an improvement in insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss .
The DASH diet may play an important role in glycemic control in long- term interventions .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : Vildagliptin and thiazolidinedione may be effective in reducing glycemic variability and improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Initial combination therapy with DPP-IV inhibitors more effectively reduced MAGE than stepwise add-on therapies ( p = 0.006 ) , although no differences in MAGE were found based on HbA1c values .
These findings indicate that DPP-IV inhibitors are promising alternatives for reducing GV in type 2 diabetes patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that low-intensity physical activity training is effective in improving physical capacity and improving upper body strength and endurance capacity in people with spinal cord injury .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of high-intensity training on upper body physical capacity or upper body endurance capacity .
The results suggest that there is no consistent evidence to support the use of a high- intensity physical activity program in the rehabilitation of people with SCI
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : Exercise training programs seem to be effective in improving wheelchair propulsion capacity .
However , there is remarkably little research , particularly for individuals who do not have spinal-cord injury
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review suggest that there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the association between PTSD and childhood trauma .
However , there is some evidence to suggest that childhood trauma may be associated with an increased risk of developing PTSD in later life .
Conclusions There is limited evidence to support a relationship between childhood trauma and the development of PTSD
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion : Combinations of peri- and post-injury factors appear to be influential in the development of PTSD among persons with SCI .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Compared with aRT , eSRT is superior to aRT in terms of BCR-free survival and is associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer recurrence .
However , the current evidence does not support the use of aRT for all-cause mortality in PCa .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Zoledronic acid and denosumab can be used in men with mCRPC and osseous metastases to prevent skeletal-related complications .
PATIENT SUMMARY In men with a rise in their PSA levels after prior local treatment for prostate cancer only , it is important to balance overtreatment against further progression of the disease since survival and quality of life may never be affected in many of these patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis support the use of magnification lenses in dental education to improve the working posture of dental students .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support their use in clinical practice or education .
INFO:root:Reference summary: CONCLUSIONS Based on a limited number of studies , the use of ergonomic saddle seats and dental loupes leads to improved working postures .
The use of loupes appears to relieve shoulder , arm and h and pain .
However , their effect on neck pain is scarce .
None of the studies reported on the effect of the saddle seats on musculoskeletal pain .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions MTA has a higher success rate than formocresol in pulpotomy in primary molars with carious pulp exposure .
MTA is superior to FC in terms of clinical and radiographic success rate .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of insoles on balance and gait performance in patients with balance impairments .
Insoles may improve balance , gait , and walking performance in people with balance or gait impairments , but they may not improve gait or walking ability in people who do not have a balance impairment
INFO:root:Reference summary: A moderate level of evidence was found in support of using cushioned material s in reducing discomfort/fatigue among st and ing workers .
A limited level of evidence exists in favour of using insoles over anti-fatigue mats .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Our findings suggest that social adversities may be associated with an increased risk of developing a range of chronic physical and mental health conditions in later life .
However , the association between social factors and physical health is not clear .
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention

However , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of estrogen alone or in combination with progestin for the treatment of depression and anxiety in older women
INFO:root:Reference summary: This moderate to large effect size , showing lower ratings of depressed mood in treated patients compared with controls , implicated HRT as a potential treatment of or prophylactic for depression in menopausal women .
One can generalize from the studies review ed here only with great caution , but there is little evidence to support the use of estradiol to improve mood in nondepressed patients ( not surprisingly ) and some evidence to support the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal women
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that probiotic supplementation is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract infections in infants and toddlers .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of probiotics on the prevention of other types of infections .
INFO:root:Reference summary: We found no evidence to support a protective association between perinatal use of probiotics and doctor diagnosed asthma or childhood wheeze .
R and omised controlled trials to date have not yielded sufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the primary prevention of these disorders .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of exercise interventions for the management of frailty in older adults .
However , there is some evidence to suggest that exercise interventions may be effective in improving physical function and reducing the risk of falling in this population
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion Frequency of 1–6 sessions per week , training volume of 1–3 sets of 6–15 repetitions and intensity of 30–70%1-RM promoted significant enhancements on muscle strength , muscle power , and functional outcomes .
Therefore , in agreement with previous studies , we suggest that supervised and controlled RT represents an effective intervention in frailty treatment
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to support the use of immediate ADT for the detection of PCa in men younger than age 65 years .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy .
PSA doubling time in < 3 yr or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention .
In men with locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not m and atory , watchful waiting ( WW ) is a treatment alternative to and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) with equivalent oncologic efficacy .
Active treatment is mostly recommended for patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy  with  radical prostatectomy ( RP ) shown to be superior to WW in a prospect i ve r and omised trial .
Nerve-sparing RP represents the approach of choice in organ
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion Resveratrol  improves insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that resveratols may be an effective intervention to improve insulin sensitivity in patients who are at high risk of developing COPD .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) may be an effective intervention for reducing weight gain in people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results The results of the meta- analysis show an effect toward the experimental group .
Notably , prevention studies with individual psychoeducational programmes that include diet and /or physical activity seem to have the highest impact .
Conclusions When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and individual lifestyle interventions that include diet and physical activity generally prove to be effective in reducing weight .
This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion Pulp capping with MTA is effective in the treatment of carious pulp exposures in young permanent teeth .

INFO:root:Reference summary: Strict control [ systolic BP ( SBP ) < 140 mmHg ] was not consistently better than mild control ( SBP < 150 mmHg ) for adults aged ≥65 years .
Mild SBP control benefitted subjects in all age ranges over 65 years .
Conclusions In this review , older adults with hypertension had decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  with antihypertensives compared with no treatment .
Strict control was not consistently better than mild control in older adults .
The current evidence is insufficient to determine the safest , most beneficial hypertension regimen in older adults
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this meta- analysis suggest that fluoxetine may be an effective and safe option for the prophylaxis of migraine .
However , it is not clear whether it is superior to other anticonvulsants in terms of efficacy , safety , or efficacy .
The current evidence does not support the use of antidepressants for the prevention of migraine
INFO:root:Reference summary: Over 2 months of treatment , SSRIs are no more efficacious than placebo in patients with migraine .
In patients with chronic TTH , SSRIs are less efficacious than tricyclic antidepressants .
In comparison with SSRIs , the burden of adverse events in patients receiving tricyclics was greater .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions SSSDs are associated with an increase in body weight , BMI , blood lipids , triglycerides , and fibrinogen concentrations .
Sucrose-sweetened beverages are a common source of added sugars in the diet of overweight/obese adults .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Subgroup analyses showed the most marked relation between sugar intakes and lipids in studies in which efforts were made to ensure an energy balance and when no difference in weight change was reported .
CONCLUSIONS Dietary sugars  influence blood pressure and serum lipids .
The relation is independent of effects of  sugars on body weight .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis identified a number of risk factors for musculoskeletal injuries in light infantry recruits .
The majority of these risk factors were associated with a lower body mass index ( BMI ) , high body fat percentage , smoking , and physical activity level .
However , the study did not identify any single risk factor that was associated with an increased risk of musculo-fitness-related injuries .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about which risk factors are associated with the incidence of these injuries .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Primary findings indicate that there is ( a ) strong evidence that poor performance on a set distance run for time is a predictor for MSK-I risk in both genders ; ( b ) strong evidence that poor performance on timed shuttle runs is a predictor for MSK-I risk in males ; ( c ) moderate evidence in males and limited evidence in females that poor performance on a timed step test is a predictor of MSK-I risk ; and ( d ) limited or insufficient evidence that poor performance on the Cooper run test , maximal and submaximal aerobic grade d exercise tests , and the Conconi test are predictors of MSK-I risk in males or females or both .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion Resveratrol supplementation is effective in improving glycemic control and improving insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that RES supplementation may have a role in improving glucose homeostasis in T2DM patients .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The drug also reduced homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) index , systolic blood pressure , and diastolic blood pressure among participants with T2DM .
The changes in hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negligible .
Subgroup analysis comparing the resveratrol supplementation doses of < 100 mg/d versus ≥ 100 mg/d revealed a significant difference in fasting plasma glucose .
In particular , the latter dose presented more favorable results .
This meta- analysis provides evidence that supplementation of resveratrol may benefit management of T2DM
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that the polishing of nanocomposite surfaces is associated with an increase in surface roughness and microhardness , as well as with a decrease in the microstructure of the composites .
However , there was no significant difference between the two types of polishing techniques in terms of microst and micro-hardness .
In conclusion , there is no evidence to support the use of any single polishing technique for the treatment of the surface of composites
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is no in vitro evidence to support the choice for nanofill or su bmi cron composites over traditional microhybrids based on better surface smoothness and /or gloss , or based upon maintenance of those superficial characteristics after surface challenges
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis suggests that physical activity interventions are safe and effective in improving physical performance and reducing the risk of falls in community-dwelling older adults with a history of falls .
However , there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of physical activity in the rehabilitation of older adults who have a previous fall
INFO:root:Reference summary: The multi-component exercise intervention composed by strength , endurance and balance training seems to be the best strategy to improve rate of falls , gait ability , balance , and strength performance in physically frail older adults

However , dairy consumption is associated with a lower risk of CVD in the general population .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results of the analysis indicated that increased consumption of unsaturated fats , fruits , vegetables and low-fat dietary products  , decreased consumption of dietary sodium and beverages containing caffeine , and breastfeeding were found to have preventive effects against high blood pressure in later years of life .
The effects of training given during youth to encourage a healthy lifestyle and behavior changes based on diet and physical activity were also noted
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that lactulose supplementation is safe and effective in reducing the risk of C and ida colonization in preterm infants .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of MCT supplementation on the prevention of LOS .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In RCTs , pasteurized human donor milk , as opposed to formula , reduced NEC but not infections or mortality .
Pooled data of small trials and a recent large RCT suggested that bovine lactoferrin reduced rates of fungal sepsis without impact on other infections , NEC , or mortality .
Pooled data of RCTs assessing the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides found reduced infection but not mortality .
A meta- analysis sensitivity approach found multiple-strain ( but not single-strain ) probiotics to be highly effective in reducing NEC and mortality .
Thus , selected food components may help to improve outcomes in preterm infants

Behavioural interventions were associated with better long-term outcomes in children with ADHD .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results suggest there is moderate-to-high-level evidence that combined pharmacological and behavioral interventions , and pharmacological interventions alone can be effective in managing the core ADHD symptoms and academic performance at 14 months .
However , the effect size may decrease beyond this period .
This review has highlighted the paucity and limitations of the evidence investigating the long-term outcomes of recommended interventions for managing ADHD symptoms .
There is little evidence to suggest that the effects observed over the relatively short term are maintained throughout longer periods of impairment .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that the use of a 3-cyc/deg square-wave grating with a light-coloured background is effective in improving reading ability in children with dyslexia .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of the use or non-use of coloured filters in adults .
INFO:root:Reference summary: While many studies report improvements with coloured lenses , the effect size is generally small and /or similar to the improvement found with a placebo condition .
Consistent with previous review s and advice from several professional bodies , we conclude that the use of coloured lenses or overlays to ameliorate reading difficulties can not be endorsed and that any benefits reported by individuals in clinical setting s are likely to be the result of placebo , practice or Hawthorne effects
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : Preoperative warming is associated with a lower risk of developing perioperative normothermia after colorectal or pancreas surgery .
Preoperative warming may be a useful strategy for reducing the occurrence of postoperative  erythema , but the evidence is limited

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that methylpheni date is associated with an increase in dopamine levels in the basal ganglia , cerebellum , frontal lobes , and striatal regions .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of methyl pheni date on other brain regions .
INFO:root:Reference summary: RESULTS The fMRI analysis showed that methylpheni date significantly enhanced activation in bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC)/insula during inhibition and time discrimination but had no effect on working memory networks .
The meta- analysis , including 14 fMRI data sets and 212 children with ADHD , showed that stimulants most consistently enhanced right IFC/insula activation , which also remained for a subgroup analysis of methylpheni date effects alone .
A more lenient threshold also revealed increased putamen activation .
CONCLUSIONS Psychostimulants most consistently increase right IFC/insula activation , which are key areas of cognitive control and also the most replicated neurocognitive dysfunction in ADHD .
These neurocognitive effects may underlie their positive clinical

These findings suggest that there is an association between vasomotor symptoms and metabolic health outcomes .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , the current evidence does not support the use of imageless navigation for THA .
There is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the optimal positioning of THA implants .
However , there is enough evidence to suggest that the current state of the art in THA navigation is not sufficiently advanced to justify the routine use of this technique
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results Significant differences were found in the femoral offset and overall complication rate between the conventional and navigation groups .
Additionally , the conventional group had significantly less anteversion than the navigation group .
However , the navigation group had significantly better inclination .
The operation time was significantly shorter in the conventional than navigation group .
Conclusion Both the OrthoPilot navigation system and conventional total hip arthroplasty result in significant improvements in patient function with similar overall complication rates and have their own advantages in achieving good cup position .
The conventional procedure has a shorter operation time than does use of a navigation system
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence for the effectiveness of financial incentives on tuberculosis ( TB ) skin test reading in reducing the incidence of positive tuberculin test results .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was not convincing evidence that effects were different between different groups of behaviours .
Meta-regression found some , limited , evidence that effect sizes decreased as post-intervention follow-up period and incentive value increased .
However , the latter effect may be confounded by the former .
The available evidence suggests that financial incentive interventions are more effective than usual care or no intervention for encouraging healthy behaviour change .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion Probiotic supplementation may improve glycemic control and reduce weight gain in pregnant women with GDM .
The current evidence does not support the use of probiotics for the prevention or treatment of GDM
INFO:root:Reference summary: Among secondary endpoints , a significant reduction of maternal insulin ( both in women with or without diabetes ) was observed in the probiotics group .
INTERPRETATION Probiotics during pregnancy do not reduce the incidence of GDM , with a very little ( statistically but not clinical ly significant ) reduction of fasting plasma glucose

However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the effects of Serenosa repens on erectile function or on other aspects of the urological system
INFO:root:Reference summary: S. repens is safe in its application .
We suggest that strong placebo effect , potentially influenced by positive patients ' expectation on S. repens , shapes both the clinical practice outcomes and the findings of clinical trials .
Hitherto , the totality of evidence continues to suggest that S. repens is a prudent therapeutic option as part of the naturopathic treatment for LUTS/BPH .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that iodine supplementation is associated with improvements in cognitive and psychomotor performance in children and adolescents who are moderately to severely iodine-deficient .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of long-term iodine supplementation on cognitive performance in this population .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Controlled trials on infant neurodevelopment were lacking ; gestational iodine supplementation reduced maternal thyroid volume and serum thyroglobulin and in some studies prevented a rise in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone .
Iodine supplementation improves some maternal thyroid indices and may benefit aspects of cognitive function in school-age children , even in marginally iodine-deficient areas .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that NF may be an effective treatment for ADHD in children and adolescents with an ADHD diagnosis .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about its efficacy in adults with ADHD .
INFO:root:Reference summary: When only trials are considered that include probably blinded ratings or those that are sham-NF or semi-active controlled or those that employed optimally titration procedures , the findings do not support theta/beta NF as a st and alone treatment for children or adolescents with ADHD .
This review concludes that the present role of NF in treating children diagnosed with ADHD should be considered as complementary in a multimodal treatment approach , individualized to the needs of the child , and may be considered a viable alternative to stimulants for a specific group of patients .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Olanzapine is superior to haloperidol and risperidone in terms of efficacy , safety and tolerability in the treatment of bipolar disorder .
The efficacy and safety of olanZapine are comparable to those of other antipsychotic drugs in the management of BPD .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for  acute mania .
From the limited data available , there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone .
Some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that MUFA-based diets are effective in improving glycaemic control in people at high risk of CVD .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of MUFA supplementation on insulin sensitivity or on other parameters .
The current evidence suggests that MUFAs are not associated with improvements in glucose , HbA1c , LDL-cholesterol , TG , or insulin levels .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In contrast , fasting plasma glucose , fasting plasma insulin as well as the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were not affected by the amounts of MUFA in the dietary protocol s. Conclusions : In summary , this systematic review found that high MUFA diets appear to be effective in reducing HbA1c , and therefore , should be recommended in the dietary regimes of T2D
INFO:root:Generated summary: Preoperative physical training may reduce the risk of developing postoperative pulmonary complications after cardiac surgery .
However , there is insufficient evidence to determine the long-term effects of physical training on pulmonary function .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Evidence derived from small trials suggests that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pulmonary complications ( atelectasis and pneumonia ) and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery .
There is a lack of evidence that preoperative physical therapy reduces postoperative pneumothorax , prolonged mechanical ventilation or all-cause deaths
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant association between total protein intake and hip fracture risk .
Conclusions The current evidence suggests that dairy products are associated with a lower risk of hip fracture in older adults than controls .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In the present meta- analysis , reductions in the risk of hip fracture  with milk consumption were only observed among American adults , but not among Sc and inavian adults , possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Sc and inavian countries .
The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption , which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health .
Fueling this uncertainty , the elevated  risk of hip fracture  in association with  milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women .
The cumulative evidence from prospect i ve cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Hydrolyzed protein formula ( HPF ) is effective in improving gastrointestinal motility in preterm infants with feeding intolerance .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of hydrolysate formula for improving gastro-intestinal motility or reducing the incidence of gastro-esophageal reflux disease .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The identified trials provide only low quality evidence about the effects of feeding preterm infants  with protein hydrolysate versus st and ard formula .
The existing data did not support conclusions that feeding with protein hydrolysate affects the risk of feed intolerance or necrotising enterocolitis .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of pedometer-based physical activity interventions on physical activity or on blood pressure in adults .
INFO:root:Reference summary: In general , 100 steps/minute is prescribed for adults to achieve moderate intensity , but older adults may require a higher cadence .
Currently , few studies have explored using walking cadence prescription as an intervention to increase physical activity levels .
Conclusion .
Prescribing walking cadence as a way to increase physical activity levels has potential as a practical and useful strategy , but more evidence is required to assess its ability to increase physical activity levels at moderate intensity
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , low adiponectin levels are associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the association of high adipo-insulin levels with a higher prostate cancer risk
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The current evidence does not suggest an association between leptin and PCa outcome .
However , there may be an inverse association between adiponectin and the incidence of advanced PCa that should be investigated by further studies .
INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , the current evidence does not support the routine use of large doses of vitamin C for the prevention and treatment of colds .
The current evidence suggests that vitamin C is safe and effective in preventing colds , but that it is not suitable for use as a prophylactic vitamin for the treatment of other conditions .
INFO:root:Reference summary: REVIEW ERS ' CONCLUSIONS The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use .
But evidence shows that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and /or cold environments .
Also , the consistent and statistically significant small benefits on duration and severity for those using regular vitamin C prophylaxis indicates that vitamin C plays some role in respiratory defence mechanisms .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The RMQ has been shown to be sensitive to clinical ly relevant changes in patients ’ quality of life and to be responsive to changes in medication dosages .
However , there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the RMQ is suitable for use as a measure of health-related quality-of-life in clinical trials
INFO:root:Reference summary: There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options .
Negative changes were not associated with larger ESs .
Population -based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with smaller ESs , and acute conditions with larger ESs .

: While growing up , preterm-born children have increasing difficulties with complex language function
INFO:root:Generated summary: Vitamin D supplementation is associated with a lower risk of developing asthma and an increased risk of all-cause mortality in children and adolescents .
However , there is insufficient evidence from r and omized controlled trials to draw firm conclusions about the effects of vitamin D supplementation on other outcomes such as bone mineral density and bone mineral content .
VitaminD supplementation does not appear to be associated with an increase in the risk of any other adverse outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusions The available very low to low quality evidence does not confirm or rule out beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation in children with asthma .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The DASH diet was associated with a significant reduction in total cholesterol , LDL-C , triglycerides , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , as well as a significant increase in HDL-C .
In conclusion , the DASH dietary pattern appears to have a beneficial effect on cardiometabolic risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes
INFO:root:Reference summary: The DASH dietary pattern may lead to an improvement in insulin sensitivity independent of weight loss .
The DASH diet may play an important role in glycemic control in long- term interventions .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Vildagliptin significantly improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with metformin .
The results of this meta- analysis suggest that vildaglptin is associated with a significant reduction in glycemic variability and a significant increase in glycaemic control in T2DM patients
INFO:root:Reference summary: Initial combination therapy with DPP-IV inhibitors more effectively reduced MAGE than stepwise add-on therapies ( p = 0.006 ) , although no differences in MAGE were found based on HbA1c values .

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that the use of magnification lenses may improve the working posture of dental students .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions regarding the effects of magnification on the clinical performance of dental professionals
INFO:root:Reference summary: CONCLUSIONS Based on a limited number of studies , the use of ergonomic saddle seats and dental loupes leads to improved working postures .
The use of loupes appears to relieve shoulder , arm and h and pain .
However , their effect on neck pain is scarce .
None of the studies reported on the effect of the saddle seats on musculoskeletal pain .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that MTA is superior to formocresol in terms of long-term clinical and radiographic success rate , as well as for the prevention of root resorption and post-treatment disease in primary molars with carious pulp exposure following pulpotomy

INFO:root:Generated summary: In conclusion , the current evidence does not support the use of glycerine-filled insoles for balance or gait in patients with balance impairments .
INFO:root:Reference summary: A moderate level of evidence was found in support of using cushioned material s in reducing discomfort/fatigue among st and ing workers .
A limited level of evidence exists in favour of using insoles over anti-fatigue mats .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review provides evidence for a positive association between social adversities and risk factors for a range of chronic physical and mental health disorders .
However , it is unclear whether these associations are independent of age , sex , gender , race , ethnic group , education level , socio-economic status , or other factors .
INFO:root:Reference summary: These studies overwhelmingly support the notion that social connectedness correlates negatively with allostatic load .
Several moderators of this relationship were also identified , including gender , social status , and quality of social ties .
The current evidence strongly indicates that the more socially connected individuals are , the less likely they are to experience chronic stress and associated allostatic load .
The negative association between social connectedness and various chronic diseases can thus , at least partially , be explained by the buffering qualities of social connectedness against allostatic load .
We argue that assessing social connectedness in clinical and epidemiological setting s may therefore represent a considerable asset in terms of prevention and intervention
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions Bariatric surgery is associated with a significant reduction in total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , triglycerides , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of bariatric surgery on other cardiovascular risk factors .
Bariatric surgery does not appear to have a significant effect on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease
INFO:root:Reference summary: Patients given oral beta-lactams and macrolides warrant close monitoring due to unpredictable absorption post-bariatric surgery , whereas oral fluoroquinolones and linezolid may not be affected .
Several studies also showed decreased absorption following RYGB , as well as lower serum exposure in patients with obesity compared to non-obese controls .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that the use of estradiol is associated with an increase in negative mood and physical symptoms in postmenopausal women .
INFO:root:Reference summary: This moderate to large effect size , showing lower ratings of depressed mood in treated patients compared with controls , implicated HRT as a potential treatment of or prophylactic for depression in menopausal women .
One can generalize from the studies review ed here only with great caution , but there is little evidence to support the use of estradiol to improve mood in nondepressed patients ( not surprisingly ) and some evidence to support the antidepressant efficacy of estradiol in perimenopausal but not postmenopausal women
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis showed that probiotic supplementation is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract infections in infants and toddlers .
In particular , the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains was associated with an improvement in the risk of all-cause mortality .
The use of probiotics in the management of GI tract infections was not associated with any other adverse events .
INFO:root:Reference summary: We found no evidence to support a protective association between perinatal use of probiotics and doctor diagnosed asthma or childhood wheeze .
R and omised controlled trials to date have not yielded sufficient evidence to recommend probiotics for the primary prevention of these disorders .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Tension-guided UKA is associated with better kinematics , lower incidence of radiolucency , and a lower risk of dislocation compared with fixed bearing UKA .
However , there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of either a tension-guided or a mobile bearing for medial UKA
INFO:root:Reference summary: After stratification on follow-up time and age , the revision rates were not substantially different , aside for younger patients in short term from studies with short-term follow-up .
Conclusion No essential differences between the two design s were observed .
MB and FB UKA design s have comparable revision rates .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review suggest that resistance exercise interventions are effective in improving muscle strength and functional ability in frail older adults .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of muscle strength training on other outcomes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Conclusion Frequency of 1–6 sessions per week , training volume of 1–3 sets of 6–15 repetitions and intensity of 30–70%1-RM promoted significant enhancements on muscle strength , muscle power , and functional outcomes .
Therefore , in agreement with previous studies , we suggest that supervised and controlled RT represents an effective intervention in frailty treatment
INFO:root:Generated summary: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of prostate cancer recurrence .
There was also no difference in the risk of death .
CONCLUSIONS There is no difference between immediate and delayed ADT for PCa .
The current evidence suggests that immediate ADT is associated with an increased risk of PCa recurrence
INFO:root:Reference summary: Active surveillance represents a viable option in men with low-risk PCa and a long life expectancy .
PSA doubling time in < 3 yr or a biopsy progression indicates the need for active intervention .
In men with locally advanced PCa in whom local therapy is not m and atory , watchful waiting ( WW ) is a treatment alternative to and rogen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) with equivalent oncologic efficacy .
Active treatment is mostly recommended for patients with localised disease and a long life expectancy  with  radical prostatectomy ( RP ) shown to be superior to WW in a prospect i ve r and omised trial .
Nerve-sparing RP represents the approach of choice in organ

Significant improvement in inflammatory markers  support resveratrol as an adjunct to pharmacologic management of metabolic diseases
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis provides evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) in reducing weight in people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Results The results of the meta- analysis show an effect toward the experimental group .
Notably , prevention studies with individual psychoeducational programmes that include diet and /or physical activity seem to have the highest impact .
Conclusions When compared with treatment as usual in psychotic patients , preventive and individual lifestyle interventions that include diet and physical activity generally prove to be effective in reducing weight .
This percentage is below the 5 % to 10 % weight loss deemed sufficient to improve weight-related complications such as hypertension , type II diabetes , and dyslipidemia .
However , it is reported that outcomes associated with metabolic risk factors may have greater health implication s than weight changes alone .
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that MTA is safe and effective in the treatment of carious pulp exposures in young permanent teeth .

INFO:root:Generated summary: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a systolic BP threshold of 140/90 mm Hg or a diastolic BP goal of 120/80 mmHg for the management of high BP in older adults with hypertension .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Strict control [ systolic BP ( SBP ) < 140 mmHg ] was not consistently better than mild control ( SBP < 150 mmHg ) for adults aged ≥65 years .
Mild SBP control benefitted subjects in all age ranges over 65 years .
Conclusions In this review , older adults with hypertension had decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  with antihypertensives compared with no treatment .
Strict control was not consistently better than mild control in older adults .
The current evidence is insufficient to determine the safest , most beneficial hypertension regimen in older adults
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis support the use of antidepressants for the prevention of migraine .
Although the current evidence base is insufficient to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy and safety of antidepressants in migraine prevention , the results suggest that antidepressants may be an effective and safe option for migraine prevention
INFO:root:Reference summary: Over 2 months of treatment , SSRIs are no more efficacious than placebo in patients with migraine .
In patients with chronic TTH , SSRIs are less efficacious than tricyclic antidepressants .
In comparison with SSRIs , the burden of adverse events in patients receiving tricyclics was greater .
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions : The consumption of SSSDs is associated with an increase in total and LDL cholesterol , as well as with a decrease in HDL-C .
Sodium and fructose are associated with a greater increase in triglycerides , but not with total cholesterol , LDL-C , or HDL-c .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Subgroup analyses showed the most marked relation between sugar intakes and lipids in studies in which efforts were made to ensure an energy balance and when no difference in weight change was reported .
CONCLUSIONS Dietary sugars  influence blood pressure and serum lipids .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Behavioural interventions were associated with a greater reduction in smoking prevalence than were no-incentive interventions .
Conclusions Workplace-based smoking cessation programs are effective in reducing smoking prevalence .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effect of incentives on smoking cessation rates .
INFO:root:Reference summary: Personal financial incentives can change habitual health-related behaviors and help reduce health inequalities .
However , their role in reducing disease burden is potentially limited given current evidence that effects dissipate beyond three months post-incentive removal
INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusions This systematic review and meta- analysis identified a number of risk factors for musculoskeletal injuries in the U.S. military .

INFO:root:Generated summary: Conclusion : Resveratrol is an effective and well-tolerated dietary supplement for improving glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes .
INFO:root:Reference summary: The drug also reduced homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) index , systolic blood pressure , and diastolic blood pressure among participants with T2DM .
The changes in hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were negligible .
Subgroup analysis comparing the resveratrol supplementation doses of < 100 mg/d versus ≥ 100 mg/d revealed a significant difference in fasting plasma glucose .
In particular , the latter dose presented more favorable results .
This meta- analysis provides evidence that supplementation of resveratrol may benefit management of T2DM
INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis showed that surface roughness and microhardness were not significantly affected by polishing techniques .
However , surface discoloration was significantly increased with the use of a polishing system with a higher polishing intensity .
In conclusion , the current evidence suggests that polishing technique may have a negative impact on the microhardening of nanocomposites .
INFO:root:Reference summary: There is no in vitro evidence to support the choice for nanofill or su bmi cron composites over traditional microhybrids based on better surface smoothness and /or gloss , or based upon maintenance of those superficial characteristics after surface challenges

INFO:root:Generated summary: The results of this systematic review and meta- analysis suggest that lactulose supplementation is safe and effective in reducing the risk of C and ida colonization in preterm infants .
However , there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effects of other interventions
INFO:root:Reference summary: In RCTs , pasteurized human donor milk , as opposed to formula , reduced NEC but not infections or mortality .
Pooled data of small trials and a recent large RCT suggested that bovine lactoferrin reduced rates of fungal sepsis without impact on other infections , NEC , or mortality .
Pooled data of RCTs assessing the use of prebiotic oligosaccharides found reduced infection but not mortality .
A meta- analysis sensitivity approach found multiple-strain ( but not single-strain ) probiotics to be highly effective in reducing NEC and mortality .
Thus , selected food components may help to improve outcomes in preterm infants
